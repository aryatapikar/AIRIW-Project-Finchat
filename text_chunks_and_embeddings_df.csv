-41,"Investing can intimidate a lot of people because there are many options and it can be hard to figure out which investments are right for your portfolio. This guide walks you through ten of the most common types of investments, from stocks to commodities and explains why you may want to consider including each in your portfolio. If you're serious about investing it might make sense to find a financial advisor who can guide you and help you figure out which investments will help you reach your goals. What Are the 3 Main Investment Categories?While the types of investments are numerous, it is possible to group them into one of three categories, equity, fixed-income and cash or cash equivalents. The term ""equity"" covers any kind of investment that gives the investor an ownership stake in an enterprise. The most common example is common stocks. Other examples are preferred shares, funds that hold stocks, such as exchange-traded funds and mutual funds, private equity and American depositary receipts. The term fixed-income covers any kind of investment that entails the investors essentially loaning money to an enterprise. The most common example is bonds, which come in various forms, including corporate and government, whether local, state or federal.",1264,204,316.0
-41,"Some fixed-income securities have equity-like characteristics, such as convertible bonds. Cash and cash equivalents comprise a third type of investments. Besides bills such as you might keep in a wallet, this type includes checking accounts, savings accounts, certificates of deposit and money market accounts. Money market funds are sometimes considered cash equivalents because its easy to withdraw from such accounts, but they are technically fixed-income securities  albeit extremely secure securities.11 Types of Securities: While it is possible to put investments into one of three categories, as described above, there are many types within 1. Stocks Stocks, also known as shares or equities, might be the most well-known and simple type of investment. When you buy stock, youre buying an ownership stake in a publicly-traded company. Many of the biggest companies in the country are publicly traded, meaning you can buy stock in them. Some examples include Exxon, Apple and Microsoft. How you can make money: When you buy a stock, you're hoping that the price will go up so you can then sell it for a profit.",1119,178,279.75
-41,"The risk, of course, is that the price of the stock could go down, in which case you'd lose money.2. Bonds When you buy a bond, you're essentially lending money to an entity. Generally, this is a business or a government entity. Companies issue corporate bonds, whereas local governments issue municipal bonds. The U. S. Treasury issues Treasury bonds, notes and bills, all of which are debt instruments that investors buy. How you can make money: While the money is being lent, the lender or investor gets interest payments. After the bond matures, meaning you've held it for the contractually determined amount of time, you get your principal back. The rate of return for bonds is typically much lower than it is for stocks, but bonds also tend to be a lower risk. There is still some risk involved, of course.",812,141,203.0
-41,"The company you buy a bond from could fold or the government could default. Treasury bonds, notes and bills, however, are considered very safe investments.3. Mutual Funds A mutual fund is a pool of many investors money that is invested broadly in a number of companies. Mutual funds can be actively managed or passively managed. An actively managed fund has a fund manager who picks securities in which to put investors money. Fund managers often try to beat a designated market index by choosing investments that will outperform such an index. A passively managed fund, also known as an index fund, simply tracks a major stock market index like the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&P 500. Mutual funds can invest in a broad array of securities: equities, bonds, commodities, currencies and derivatives. Mutual funds carry many of the same risks as stocks and bonds, depending on what they are invested in.",913,153,228.25
-41,"The risk is often lesser, though, because the investments are inherentlydiversified. How you can make money:Investors make money off mutual funds when the value of stocks, bonds and other bundled securities that the fund invests in go up. You can buy them directly through the",278,45,69.5
-40,"managing firm and discount brokerages. But note there is typically a minimum investment and youll pay an annual fee.4. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are similar to mutual funds in that they are a collection of investments that tracks a market index. Unlike mutual funds, which are purchased through a fund company, shares of ETFs are bought and sold on the stock markets. Their price fluctuates throughout the trading day, whereas mutual funds value is simply the net asset value of your investments, which is calculated at the end of each trading session. How you can make money: ETFs make money from the collection of a return amongst all of their investments.ETFs are often recommended to new investors because theyre more diversified than individual stocks. You can further minimize risk by choosing an ETF that tracks a broad index. And just like mutual funds, you can make money from an ETF by selling it as it gains value.5.",963,159,240.75
-40,"Certificates of Deposit (CDs) A certificate of deposit (CD) is considered to be a very low-risk investment. You give a bank a certain amount of money for a predetermined amount of time and earn interest on that money. When that time period is over, you get your principal back, plus the predetermined amount of interest. The longer the loan period, the higher your interest rate is likely to be. While the risk is low, so is the potential return. How you can make money: With a CD, you make money from the interest that you earn during the term of the deposit.CDs are good long-term investments for saving money.There are no major risks because they are FDIC-insured up to $250,000, which would cover your money even if your bank were to collapse. That said, you have to make sure you wont need the money during the term of the CD, as there are major penalties for early withdrawals.6. Retirement Plans A retirement plan is an investment account, with certain tax benefits, where investors invest their money for retirement. There are a number of types of retirement plans such as workplace retirement plans, sponsored by your employer, including 401(k) plans and 403(b) plans.",1180,202,295.0
-40,"If you dont have access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan, you could get an individual retirement plan (IRA) or a Roth IRA. How you can make money:Retirement plans arent a separate category of investment, per se, but a vehicle to buy stocks, bonds and funds in two tax-advantaged ways. The first, lets you invest pretax dollars (as with a traditional IRA). The second, allows you to withdraw money without paying taxes on that money. The risks for the investments are the same as if you were buying the investments outside of a retirement plan.7. Options An option is a somewhat more advanced or complex way to buy a stock.When you buy an option, youre purchasing the ability to buy or sell an asset at a certain price at a given time. There are two types of options: call options, for buying assets and put options, for selling options. How you can make money:As an investor, you lock in the price of a stock with the hope that it will go up in value. However, the risk of an option is that the stock could also lose money.",1037,187,259.25
-40,"So if the stock decreases from its initial price, you lose the money of the contract.Options are an advanced investing technique and retail should exercise caution before using them.8. Annuities When you buy an annuity, you purchase an insurance policy and, in return, you get periodic payments. These payments generally come down the road in retirement but are often purchased years in advance. This is why many people use annuities as part of their retirement savings plan. Annuities come in numerous varieties. They may last until death or only for a predetermined period of time. They may require periodic premium payments or just one up-front payment. They may link partially to the stock market or they may simply be an insurance policy with no direct link to the markets.Payments may be immediate or deferred to a specified date. They may be fixed or variable.",869,144,217.25
-40,"How you can make money:Annuities can guarantee an additional stream of income for retirement. But while they are fairly low risk, they arent high-growth. So investors tend to make them a good supplement for their retirement savings, rather than an integral source of funding.9. Derivatives A derivative is a financial instrument that drives its value from another asset. Similar to an annuity, it is a contract between two parties. In this case, though, the contract is an agreement to",487,79,121.75
-39,"sell an asset at a specific price in the future. If the investor agrees to purchase the derivative then they are betting that the value wont decrease. Derivatives are considered to be a more advanced investment and are typically purchased by institutional investors. The three most common types of derivatives are: How you can make money:You can make money investing in derivatives if you are on the right side of price fluctuations. For example, if you agree to buy copper at $1,000 in nine months but the market price at that time is $2,000 then youve essentially doubled your investment.10. Commodities Commodities are physical products that you can invest in. They are common in futures markets where producers and commercial buyers  in other words, professionals  seek to hedge their financial stake in the commodities. Retail investors should make sure they thoroughly understand futures before investing in them. Partly, thats because commodities investing runs the risk that the price of a commodity will move sharply and abruptly in either direction due to sudden events.",1086,175,271.5
-39,"For instance, political actions can greatly change the value of something like oil, while the weather can impact the value of agricultural products. Heres a breakdown of the four main types of commodities: One of the primary ways that investors make money with commodities is by trading commodity futures.Investors sometimes buy commodities as a hedge for their portfolios during inflation. You can buy commodities indirectly through stocks and mutual funds or ETFs and futures contracts.11. Hybrid Investments Hybrid investments incorporate elements of equities and fixed-income securities. One such example is preferred shares, which is an equity security with a bond-like feature.Preferred stock generally comes with afixed dividend rate. Dividends to preferred shareholders are paid before dividends to common shareholders. Another difference is that if the company that issued the shares is liquidated, preferred stockholders will have access to the companys assets before common stockholders. Owners of preferred stock are behind bondholders in line for company assets, but theyre ahead of owners of common stock.",1125,164,281.25
-39,"Another type of hybrid is a convertible bond. It is a corporate bond that can be converted into shares of the company. A bond is a loan to a company, whereas a share is a share of ownership in the company. When you convert from a bond to a share, you go from being a lender to the company to a part-owner of the company. How to Buy Different Types of Investments There are two main ways for you to purchase the different types of investments you may be interested in buying, though either way will require you to have an active investment account. Each is easy to do, but only one of the two provides a service that is completely done for you. The two general ways to buy the types of investments you want are: Start an Online Brokerage Account: You can elect to manage your own investments and just open a brokerage account. This enables you to get up and running quickly with the ability to buy stock, bonds, mutual funds and more in a matter of minutes. The only downside is that you’ll be making the final financial decisions all on your own. Hire a Financial Advisor: The other way to buy multiple types of investments is to hire a financial advisor.",1159,216,289.75
-39,"The advisor can not only provide you with access to buy and trade assets but they can also help you figure out an overall financial strategy and prepare you adequately for retirement. This is more of an automated process in that you just have to approve trades or investments and the advisor takes care of the details. Your advisor can help you get a brokerage account, as needed. There are a lot of different types of investment to choose from. Some are perfect for beginners, while others require more experience and research. Each type of investment offers a different level of risk and reward, giving you a good option or two no matter what your goal might be. Investors should consider each type of investment before determining an asset allocation that aligns with their overall financial goals.

In fact, 68% of respondents said theyre worried they wont have enough money to retire. Retirement accounts are one way to save for retirement. Here are a few types of retirement accounts it may help to know about: 401(k) plan through your employer. With a 401(k), you can deposit pretax dollars through a regular deduction from your paycheck. Beth Sabin, an executive at Capital One, says, “If you have a company match through your 401(k), this can be a great place to start by contributing until you have your full match.”She also recommends upping your contribution by one percentage point to see if that’s doable for you. If it is, you might increase it by another percentage point to accelerate your savings.403(b) plan. Like 401(k) plans, 403(b) plans are employer sponsored.",913,152,228.25
-37,"One difference is that 403(b) plans are offered by public schools and some organizations that are tax-exempt. Contributions to traditional 403(b) plans are tax-deferred—just like they are with traditional 401(k) plans. So you don’t have to pay taxes on the contributions or earnings until you withdraw funds from the account. Individual retirement account (IRA). Contributions to a traditional IRA are tax-deferred. A traditional IRA is an account that’s generally self-directed and not sponsored by an employer. Once you retire and start making withdrawals, the money will be taxed at your regular income tax rate. Roth IRA. While contributions to a Roth IRA aren’t tax deductible when you make them, you may be able to withdraw your money tax-free during your retirement years.4.",781,122,195.25
-37,"Save for emergencies Making sure you have money put away in an emergency fund for unexpected life events, like needing major home repairs, may help you reduce your financial anxiety. Here are a few tips to help you start saving: Remember that interest rates can vary. It may be wise to shop around for a savings account. If you find an account with a better rate, the extra interest can add up over time. Some banks even offer high-yield savings accounts. Put extra income into your account. When you get a tax refund or a bonus at your job, you could deposit it into your savings account to give your emergency fund a boost. Set up automatic savings. With the help of your employer, you may be able to set up automatic transfers from your paycheck to your savings account. That way, the money will still be accessible to you when you need it, but you may be less tempted to use it for nonemergencies. 5.",905,166,226.25
-37,"Plan to pay off debt Paying off debt may also help you better manage your finances and money-related stress. Here are three strategies for paying off debt: The snowball method focuses on paying off your smallest balances first. You still make the minimum payments on all of your debts. And you use any extra money to pay off your smallest balance. Then you use the money you’ve freed up to pay off your next-smallest balance and so on. This could mean debts with higher interest rates might wind up taking longer to pay off. And that could cost you more in the long run. The debt avalanche method—also called the highest-interest-rate method—starts with listing your debts based on their interest rates, from highest to lowest. You put your money toward the debt with the highest interest rate first. Once that’s paid off, those extra funds can be used to pay off the next debt on your list.",891,157,222.75

Lenders may use your credit scores to help decide whether to approve you for credit and what terms to offer you. Your credit scores can even come into play when it comes to things like renting an apartment or applying for a job. Here are a few good credit habits: Pay your bills on time, every time. Late payments can impact your credit scores and trigger late fees and penalty APRs. Don’t get close to your credit limits. The CFPB recommends keeping your credit utilization ratio below 30%. Work at establishing a long credit history. Before closing a credit account, make sure to think through how it may affect your credit scores.",778,138,194.5

Now, it's time to choose the type of account you'll use. Each has its own features, benefits,  and drawbacks.

-34,"If so, it's to  your advantage to consider these alternatives, which have special tax incentives: Besides reputation and fit with your investment strategy and goals, broker fees are the most  important consideration when you're choosing a brokerage firm, which comes in the next step.3 Let's  prepare. Traditionally, brokerages have charged fees through trade commissions, account maintenance  fees, and fees for additional services like research or financial advice. However, the landscape of  brokerage fees has evolved significantly in recent years.4Here's what you'll want to look for as  you do your research: Trading commissions: A broker might charge a commission every time you trade a stock, whether you  buy or sell. Trading fees range from $2 per trade to $10. Some brokers charge no trade commissions  at all, but they make up for it with other fees. Depending on how often you plan to trade, these  fees can add up, affect your portfolio's return, and deplete the money you have available to invest. Let's see this in action: Suppose you buy one share of stock in five companies with $1,000. Assuming a transaction fee of $10, you will incur $50 in trading costs which is equivalent to 5% of  your $1,000. Should you sell these stocks, the round trip (buying and then selling) would cost you  a total of $100, or 10% of your initial deposit amount of $1,000. Maintenance fees: Some brokerages charge monthly or annual fees to keep your account active.",1465,252,366.25
-34,"These  might be waived, though, if your account balance is above a certain threshold. Service fees: You might pay additional fees if you haven't used your account in a while. Brokers  also may charge for services like broker-assisted trades, access to their premium research, and  trading on margin (by borrowing). Most of these fees and the services linked to them are optional. Subscription-based models: As Generation Zers and Millennials take up a larger share of the  investment space, financial advisors, planners, and brokers are taking on clients used to  month-to-month or yearly fees for apps and app-based services. Instead of paying per transaction or  for specific services, you pay a flat monthly or annual fee.

These are passively managed funds that aim to track the performance of a  particular market index.

By mirroring the composition of  a chosen index, these funds provide broad exposure to the market without the need for extensive  research or stock-picking expertise. According to the S&P Indices Versus Active scorecards, a  widely respected benchmark, about 90% of actively managed funds didn't match the returns of the S&P  500 over 10 and 15-year periods.7 This is stark but winning information for a beginner: the most  effortless route might be the most profitable. Blue-chip stocks: Perhaps the most classic investing advice is to buy shares of well-established,  stable companies with a history of consistent growth and dividend payments. The blue chipsnamed  for the traditional color of the highest-value poker chipsoften have strong brand recognition, a  solid market position, and a track record of weathering economic downturns. Investing in blue-chip  stocks can provide beginner investors with a sense of stability and the potential for steady  returns over the long term. Examples of blue-chip stocks include Apple (AAPL), known for its  ubiquitous technology products and loyal customer base; JP Morgan & Chase Co (JPM), the banking  giant; Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), a healthcare giant that also owns manufacturers of many consumer  goods; and Coca-Cola (KO), the soft drink maker that has announced dividends each year since 1893. Dividend aristocrats: Coca-Cola is not just a blue-chip stock but also belongs to this select  group, which was given this informal name for giving and increasing their dividends for at least 25  consecutive years.8 By investing in dividend aristocrats, beginners can benefit from the potential  for rising income and the chance to reinvest the dividends for compound growth. Examples include  ExxonMobil (XOM), one of the world's largest oil and gas companies with a history of solid cash  generation; Procter & Gamble Co. (PG), the consumer products multinational; and Walmart (WMT), the  retail behemoth. Low-volatility stocks: These companies' shares have historically had fewer swings in price,  providing more stability to portfolios and, not for nothing, investor heart rates.9 These stocks  often belong to ""defensive sectors"" (recession-proof parts of the economy) such as utilities,  consumer staples, and healthcare.",2503,410,625.75

The potential drawback for each of these investing strategies is that you might not see the  outsized growth riskier stocks could provide. Plus, past performance does not determine future  results.

-30,"What Is Financial Analysis? Financial analysis is the process of evaluating businesses, projects, budgets, and other  finance-related transactions to determine their performance and suitability. Typically, financial  analysis is used to analyze whether an entity is stable, solvent, liquid, or profitable enough to  warrant a monetary investment. KEY TAKEAWAYS If conducted internally, financial analysis can help fund managers make future business decisions or r eview historical trends for past successes. If conducted externally, financial analysis can help investors choose the best possible investment opportunities. Fundamental analysis and technical analysis are the two main types of financial analysis. Fundamental analysis uses ratios and financial statement data to determine the intrinsic value of a security. Technical analysis assumes a security's value is already determined by its price, and it focuses instead on trends in value over time. Understanding Financial Analysis Financial analysis is used to evaluate economic trends, set financial policy, build long-term plans  for business activity, and identify projects or companies for investment. This is done through the  synthesis of financial numbers and data.",1231,177,307.75
-30,"A financial analyst will thoroughly examine a company's  financial statementsthe income statement, balance sheet, and cash flow statement. Financial  analysis can be conducted in both corporate finance and investment finance settings. One of the most common ways to analyze financial data is to calculate ratios from the data in the  financial statements to compare against those of other companies or against the company's own  historical performance. For example, return on assets (ROA) is a common ratio used to determine how efficient a company is  at using its assets and as a measure of profitability. This ratio could be calculated for several  companies in the same industry and compared to one another as part of a larger analysis. There is no single best financial analytic ratio or calculation. Most often, analysts use a c ombination of data to arrive at their conclusion. Corporate Financial Analysis In corporate finance, the analysis is conducted internally by the accounting department and shared  with management in order to improve business decision making. This type of internal analysis may  include ratios such as net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) to find projects  worth executing. Many companies extend credit to their customers.",1277,208,319.25
-30,"As a result, the cash receipt from sales may be  delayed for a period of time. For companies with large receivable balances, it is useful to track  days sales outstanding (DSO), which helps the company identify the length of time it takes to turn  a credit sale into cash. The average collection period is an important aspect of a company's  overall cash conversion cycle. A key area of corporate financial analysis involves extrapolating a company's past performance,  such as net earnings or profit margin, into an estimate of the company's future performance. This  type of historical trend analysis is beneficial to identify seasonal trends. For example, retailers may see a drastic upswing in sales in the few months leading up to  Christmas. This allows the business to forecast budgets and make decisions, such as necessary  minimum inventory levels, based on past trends. Investment Financial Analysis",909,153,227.25
-29,"In investment finance, an analyst external to the company conducts an analysis for investment  purposes. Analysts can either conduct a top-down or bottom-up investment approach. A top-down  approach first looks for macroeconomic opportunities, such as high-performing sectors, and then  drills down to find the best companies within that sector. From this point, they further analyze  the stocks of specific companies to choose potentially successful ones as investments by looking  last at a particular company'sfundamentals. A bottom-up approach, on the other hand, looks at a specific company and conducts a similar ratio  analysis to the ones used in corporate financial analysis, looking at past performance and expected  future performance as investment indicators. Bottom-up investing forces investors to  considermicroeconomicfactors first and foremost. These factors include a company's overall  financial health, analysis of financial statements, the products and services offered, supply and  demand, and other individual indicators of corporate performance over time. Financial analysis is only useful as a comparative tool. Calculating a single instance of data is u sually worthless; comparing that data against prior periods, other general ledger accounts, or competitor financial information yields useful information. Types of Financial Analysis There are two types of financial analysis: fundamental analysis and technical analysis.",1453,211,363.25
-29,"Fundamental Analysis Fundamental analysis uses ratios gathered from data within the financial statements, such as a  company's earnings per share (EPS), in order to determine the business's value. Using ratio  analysis in addition to a thorough review of economic and financial situations surrounding the  company, the analyst is able to arrive at an intrinsic value for the security. The end goal is to  arrive at a number that an investor can compare with a security's current price in order to see  whether the security is undervalued or overvalued. Technical Analysis Technical analysis uses statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as moving averages  (MA). Essentially, technical analysis assumes that a securitys price already reflects all publicly  available information and instead focuses on thestatistical analysis of price movements. Technical  analysis attempts to understand the market sentiment behind price trends by looking for patterns  and trends rather than analyzing a securitys fundamental attributes. Horizontal vs. Vertical Analysis When reviewing a company's financial statements, two common types of financial analysis are  horizontal analysis and vertical analysis. Both use the same set of data, though each analytical  approach is different. Horizontal analysis entails selecting several years of comparable financial data. One year is  selected as the baseline, often the oldest.",1427,218,356.75
-29,"Then, each account for each subsequent year is compared  to this baseline, creating a percentage that easily identifies which accounts are growing  (hopefully revenue) and which accounts are shrinking (hopefully expenses). Vertical analysis entails choosing a specific line item benchmark, then seeing how every other  component on a financial statement compares to that benchmark. Most often, net sales is used as the  benchmark. A company would then compare cost of goods sold, gross profit, operating profit, or net income as a percentage to this benchmark. Companies can then track how the percent changes over time. Examples of Financial Analysis In the nine-month period ending Sept. 30, 2022, Amazon.com reported a net loss of $3 billion. This  was a substantial decline from one year ago where the company reported net income of over $19  billion.1 Financial analysis shows some interesting facets of the company's earnings per share (shown above. On one hand, the company's EPS through the first three quarters was -$0.29; compared to the prior  year, Amazon earned $1.88 per share. This dramatic difference was not present looking only at the  third quarter of 2022 compared to 2021. Though EPS did decline from one year to the next, the",1247,207,311.75
-28,"company's EPS for each third quarter was comparable ($0.31 per share vs. $0.28 per share). Analysts can also use the information above to perform corporate financial analysis. For example,  consider Amazon's operating profit margins below. From Q3 2021 to Q3 2022, the company experienced a decline in operating margin, allowing for  financial analysis to reveal that the company simply earns less operating income for every dollar  of sales.

What Techniques Are Used in Conducting Financial Analysis?Analysts can use vertical analysis to compare each component of a financial statement as a percentage of a baseline (such as each component as a percentage of total sales). Alternatively, analysts can perform horizontal analysis by comparing one baseline year's financial results to other years. Many financial analysis techniques involve analyzing growth rates including regression analysis, year-over-year growth, top-down analysis such as market share percentage, or bottom-up analysis such as revenue driver analysis. Last, financial analysis often entails the use of financial metrics and ratios. These techniques include quotients relating to the liquidity, solvency, profitability, or efficiency (turnover of resources) of a company.

A financial plan essentially converts your dreams and goals into financial milestones and maps these goals against your current and future resources. Financial planning is, therefore, based on 4 fundamental premises 1. The financial plan must be capable of generating the highest possible real return for a given level of risk that you are willing to take.2. The financial plan must necessarily ensure that for any target return that you are aiming at, the risk should be the minimum 3. Liquidity is an important component of your financial plan and the plan needs to ensure that liquidity is made available to you when and in the quantity required 4. Lastly, your financial plan must be tax efficient. What it means is that returns must always be judged in terms of post-tax returns. We shall focus in detail only on the tax aspects here.",956,161,239.0
-27,"Taxation becomes relevant at various stages of your financial plan. For example, there is a tax rebate when you invest in select categories of investments. Secondly, there is also a tax implication when you earn regular returns in the form of interest or dividends. Thirdly, there is a tax implication at the time the capital gains are realized on assets. Lastly, there is the all important concept of EET that could change the economics of your financial plan. Let us understand each of these aspects in elaborate detail Tax breaks at the time of investing One of the basic principles of long term investing is that you must not focus overly on the tax aspect. But given a choice, you need to consider a more tax efficient option. If you need to make an allocation of Rs.100,000 during the year to mutual funds, then should you do it in diversified equity funds or an ELSS. Remember, an ELSS is also an equity fund with a 3-year lock period and giving the additional benefit under Section 80C. So instead of buying an endowment insurance policy, you can buy a term plan and the balance money saved can be invested in an ELSS. This will ensure that you get adequate life cover and your money grows in ELSS giving you additional benefits under Section 80C. The 30% exemption in the year of investing substantially improves your yield on the fund.",1345,238,336.25
-27,"Tax implications of regular income on investments This is an important consideration when you have to choose between similar investment products. Assume that you have an allocation of 20% to debt products during the year. You can invest in a bank FD but then the interest earned on the FD will be taxed at the peak rate of tax applicable to you. That will substantially reduce your post-tax returns. On the contrary, if you invest the money in debt mutual funds and opt for a dividend plan, then the dividend earned by you will be entirely tax-free in your hands. You also get the added benefit of capital appreciation when the interest rates go down, further adding to your post-tax yields. Tax exemption at the time of booking profits This factor is very relevant when you are actually comparing equity versus debt. Remember, the definition of capital gains is much more favourable in the case of equities as compared to debt. For example, in case of equities and equity mutual funds, the definition of long term is determined by the holding period of 1 year. Additionally, STCG for equities is charged at a concessional rate of 15% while the LTCG on equities are entirely tax exempt.",1186,206,296.5
-27,"Alternatively, if you own a debt fund with a growth option then it will be long term only if it is held for 3 years. In this case, short term capital gains will be taxed at your peak rate while long term gains will be taxed at 20% after considering indexation. A good option for you to consider will be the Balanced Fund plan since it combines the benefits of debt and equity. Additionally, if it has a 65% equity component then it is also classified as an equity fund for tax purposes. Understanding EEE and EET when it comes to redemption When you currently invest in an endowment life policy or in a provident fund, it is classified as EEE (Exempt, Exempt, and Exempt). That means, there is tax exemption at the time of investment, tax exemption on returns and also tax exemption on redemption.

Companies must meet certain requirement criteria, which are determined by the publishers of the index before being added to the S&P.

Market capitalization represents  the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding equity shares. Market cap is calculated by  multiplying the total number of outstanding shares of stock by the company's current stock price. For example, a company with 20 million shares outstanding in which its stock is selling for $100",618,102,154.5

It is not uncommon for three-quarters of the index's return to be  linked to only 50 to 75 stocks. Therefore, the addition or subtraction of smaller companies from the index will not have a  noticeable impact on the overall return of the index; however, the removal or addition of even just  one of the largest stocks can have a major impact.

S&P 500 components are weighted by free-float market capitalization, which means that larger companies can affect the value of the index to a greater degree.8  Top 25 Components by Market Cap  Because the exact weightings of the top 25 components are not available from S&P directly, the  weightings below are from the SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY). SPY is the oldest exchange-traded fund  (ETF) that tracks the S&P 500 and holds $406.6 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of Sept.  20, 2023, and is highly traded.9 As a result, the SPY's portfolio weightings provide a good proxy for investing in the underlying S& P 500 index, although the two may not be exactly the same. As of Sept. 21, 2023, the following are  the 25 largest S&P 500 index constituents by weight: Apple (AAPL): 7.05% Microsoft (MSFT): 6.54% Amazon (AMZN): 3.24% NVIDIA (NVDA): 2.79% Alphabet Class A (GOOGL): 2.13% Tesla (TSLA): 1.95% Alphabet Class C (GOOG): 1.83% Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.

There were 503 stocks that made up the S&P 500 as of Aug. 31, 2023. That's because some companies have multiple classes of equity shares, such as Alphabet.11 How Are Companies Selected for the S&P 500?A company must meet certain requirements for inclusion in the S&P 500, which include:A market cap of at least $14.5 billionMust be a U. S. companyA float-adjusted liquidity ratio (FALR) greater than or equal to 0.75Positive earnings over the most recent four consecutive quarters summed togetherA profitable earnings report for the company's most recent quarterLiquidity requirements32 How to Buy the S&P 500?Since the S&P 500 is an index, it can not be purchased directly; however, exchange-traded funds that mirror or track the index can be purchased, such as the State Street Global Advisors' SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY). The Bottom Line  The top 25 companies in the S&P 500 are some of the most well-known companies in the world, a large  portion of the top 10 being tech companies, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Google. To invest in the  companies in the index, investors can purchase the individual stocks of the companies or invest in  a fund that tracks the S&P 500.

There are different corporate actions that an entity can choose to initiate. A good understanding of these corporate actions gives a clear picture of the company’s financial health and determines whether to buy or sell a particular stock. This chapter will examine the five most important corporate actions and their impact on stock prices. A corporate action is initiated by the board of directors and approved by the company’s shareholders.11.2 – Dividends Dividends are portions of profits made by the company, which are distributed to the company’s shareholders.",1228,170,307.0
-17,"Dividends are paid on a per-share basis. For example, Infosys recently declared a dividend of Rs.42/- per share, which means you get Rs.42/- as dividend income for every share you own. Suppose you own 100 Infosys shares; you can get 100*42 = Rs.4,200/- as dividend income. The company directly remits the dividends to your bank account (linked to your Demat account). The dividend paid is also expressed as a percentage of the face value. In the above case, the face value of Infosys is Rs.5/-, and the dividend paid was Rs.42/- hence the dividend payout is said to be 840% (42/5). It is not mandatory to pay dividends every year. If the company feels that instead of paying dividends to shareholders, they are better off utilizing the same cash to fund a new project for a better future, they can do so. Typically, companies in the growth phase (young companies growing fast) choose not to pay dividends but rather to plow back the profits into the business for more growth. However, when the company’s growth opportunities slow down and it holds excess cash, it would make sense to reward its shareholders via dividends.",1122,193,280.5
-17,"Cash with shareholders makes more sense than retaining the cash on the company’s book, and distributing the dividends may be the best way forward for the company. The dividends need not be paid from the profits alone. If the company has made a loss during the year but it holds a healthy cash reserve, it can still pay dividends from its cash reserves. The company’s board members at the Annual General Meeting (AGM) decide whether to pay a dividend. The dividends are not paid right after the announcement. This is because the shares are traded throughout the year, and it would be difficult to identify who is eligible to receive dividends and who isn’t. The following timeline would help you understand the dividend cycle. Dividend Declaration Date: This is the date on which the AGM takes place, and the company’s board approves the dividend issue Record Date: The date the company decides to review the shareholder’s register to list all eligible shareholders for the dividend. Usually, the time difference between the dividend declaration date and the record date is 30 days. Ex-Date/Ex-Dividend date: With the T+1 settlement cycle, the ex-dividend date normally is on the same day as the record date.",1207,201,301.75
-17,"Only shareholders who own the shares before the ex-dividend date are entitled to receive the dividend. This is because, in India, the equity settlement is on a T +1 basis. So for all practical purposes, if you want to be entitled to receive a dividend, you need to ensure you buy the shares before the ex-dividend date. Dividend Payout Date: The date on which the dividends are paid to shareholders listed in the company register. Cum Dividend: The shares are said to be cum dividends till the ex-dividend date.",511,89,127.75
-16,"When the stock goes ex-dividend, usually, the stock drops to the extent of dividends paid. For example, if ITC (trading at Rs.335) has declared a dividend of Rs.15. On ex-date, the stock price will drop to the extent of the dividend paid, and as in this case, the price of ITC will drop down to Rs.320. The reason for this price drop is that the dividend amount paid no longer sits on the company’s balance sheet; hence the stock price is adjusted. From the balance sheet perspective, dividends paid are considered cash out. Hence the new stock price has to factor in the shrunk balance sheet. Hence the price drops. That said, you will not always notice a significant price drop in the share price. Sometimes, the company pays out a special dividend.",751,133,187.75
-16,"A special dividend is non-recurring and happens on a ‘one-time basis.’The special dividends are usually very large payments compared to a regular dividend, and that’s when the stock price significantly drops. The drop in stock price should not be considered negative as you would receive a cash payment as a shareholder. Lastly, dividends can be paid anytime during the financial year. If it’s paid during the financial year, it is called the interim dividend. If the dividend is paid at the end of the financial year, it is called the final dividend.11.3 – Bonus Issue A bonus issue is a stock dividend allotted by the company to reward the shareholders. In regular dividends, cash is paid out to shareholders, but in a bonus issue, stocks are paid out instead of cash. The bonus shares are issued out of the reserves of the company. The shareholders receive these free shares against shares they currently hold.",913,154,228.25
-16,"These allotments typically come in a fixed ratio of 1:1, 2:1, 3:1, etc. In a bonus issue, the stock price declines to the extent of the bonus ratio, but this decline should not be mistaken for a correction in stock price or a fall. If the ratio is 2:1, the existing shareholders get two additional shares for every share they hold at no additional cost. So if a shareholder owns 100 shares, 200 additional shares will be rewarded. The total holding after the bonus issue will become 300 shares. When the bonus shares are issued, the number of shares the shareholder holds will increase, but an investment’s overall value will remain the same. To illustrate this, let us assume a bonus issue on different ratios – 1:1, 3:1 and 5:1 Bonus Issue No.of shares held before bonus. Share price before Bonus issue Value of Investment No.of shares post Bonus.",849,149,212.25
-16,"Share price after Bonus issue Value of Investment 1:1 100 75 7,500 200 37.5 7500 3:1 30 550 16,500 120 137.5 16,500 5:1 2000",124,24,31.0
-15,"15 30,000 12,000 2.5 30,000 So as you see, in a bonus issue, only the number of shares increases, and your investment value remains the same before and after the bonus issue. The bonus announcement date, ex-bonus date, and record date are similar to the dividend issue. Companies issue bonus shares to encourage retail participation, especially when the company’s price per share is very high, and it becomes tough for new investors to buy shares. The number of outstanding shares increases by issuing bonus shares, but the share price is slashed, as shown in the example above. Think about this – fewer retail participants can buy or sell that share if the share price is bloated (I mean just the per-share price here, not the valuation). For example, the share price of MRF Limited is in the region of Rs.90,000 per share. A retail investor has to shell out 90K to buy and invest in 1 share, and this also means a small retail investor, with, say, Rs.25,000 to invest, can never buy MRF. Many retail investors spread the risk across 100s and 1000s of investors as opposed to a few investors. Hence, when the stock price bloats, companies issue a bonus share to slash the stock price without impacting any other financial metric, which is one reason to issue a bonus share. Why isn’t MRF splitting the shares, then?",1316,230,329.0
-15,"Well, at the end of the day, the decision is solely dependent on the company and I guess MRF is yet to make up their mind or perhaps they just wont indulge in these corporate actions ὤ 11.4 – Stock Split The word stock split sounds weird, but this happens regularly in the markets. What this means is quite literally – the stocks that you hold are split!Similar to a bonus issue, when the company declares a stock split, the number of shares held increases, but the investment value remains the same. The big difference between a bonus and a split is that in the bonus issue, the face value of the company remains unchanged, but in a stock split, the face value changes. Suppose the stock’s face value is Rs.10, and there is a 1:2 stock split, then the face value will change to Rs.5. If you owned one share before the split, you would now own two shares after the split. We will illustrate this with an example: Split Ratio Old FV No.of shares you own before split Share Price before split Investment Value before split New FV No.of shares you own after the split Share Price after the split Investment value after the split 1:2 10 100 900 90,000 5 200 450 90,000",1164,216,291.0
-14,"1:5 10 100 900 90,000 2 500 180 90,000 Like a bonus issue, a stock split encourages more retail participation by reducing the value per share. The dates and timeline (announcement date, ex-date, record date, etc.)are similar to dividend and bonus issues.11.5 – Rights Issue The idea behind a rights issue is to raise fresh capital. However, instead of going public, the company approaches its existing shareholders. Think about the rights issue as a second IPO and a select group of people (existing shareholders). The rights issue could indicate promising new development in the company, but this is not always true. As an investor, you need to evaluate the reasons for the right issue and determine if it makes sense. The shareholders can subscribe to the rights issue in the proportion of their shareholding. For example, 1:4 rights issue means for every four shares; the shareholder can subscribe to 1 additional share.",923,152,230.75
-14,"The new shares under the rights issue will be issued at a lower price than what prevails in the markets. For example, if a stock is trading at Rs.500 per share, then the right issue could be at a 20% discount, at Rs.400 per share. However, a word of caution – The investor should not be swayed by the company’s discount, but they should look beyond that. A rights issue is different from a bonus issue as one is paying money to acquire shares. Hence the shareholder should subscribe only if he or she is completely convinced about the company’s future. It can so happen that after the company announces the right issue, the stock price can go below the right issue price. If the market price is below the subscription price/ right issue price, it is cheaper to buy it from the open market.11.6 – Buyback of shares A buyback can be seen as a company’s method to invest in itself by buying shares from other investors in the market. Buybacks reduce the number of shares outstanding in the market; however, the buyback of shares is an important corporate restructuring method. There could be many reasons why corporates choose to buy back shares… Improve the profitability on a per-share basis To consolidate their stake in the company.",1233,218,308.25
-14,"To prevent other companies from taking over. To show the confidence of the promoters about their company. To support the share price from declining in the markets. When a company announces a buyback, it signals the company’s confidence in itself. Hence this is usually positive for the share price, but like other things in the market, always evaluate the reasons for the corporate action. Key takeaways from this chapter Corporate actions have an impact on stock prices. Dividends are a means of rewarding shareholders. The dividend is announced as a percentage of the face value. You must own the stock before the ex-dividend date to get the dividend. A bonus issue is a form of stock dividend.",696,117,174.0
-14,This is the company’s way of rewarding the shareholders with additional shares. A stock split is done based on the face value. The face value and the stock price change in proportion to the change in face value A rights issue is how the company raises fresh capital from the existing shareholders.

S. companies found in ESG portfolios with 2,428 U.

This study also determined that those companies added to ESG portfolios didn’t improve the companies’ labor or environmental compliance. Adding to the confusion, there is no universally accepted definition or ESG scoring method.8 Performance of ESG funds has been comparable with their non-ESG competitors. It remains to be seen whether ESG investing actually helps companies comply with standard global ESG initiatives or not. Is ESG Investing Ethical?ESG investing relates to ethical behavior and ascribes to the common good theory, which encourages citizens to sacrifice for the good of society. ESG strives to further ethical behavior, such as caring for the earth, treating all individuals fairly, and righting societal injustices. It’s difficult to definitively determine whether ESG investing is furthering ethical behavior and creates a better society.

How to Invest in Web 3.0   Web 3.0 offers investors different investment vehicles that can cater to different risk appetites. Nevertheless, just like every form of investment, investing in Web3 is risky and should only be  done with adequate research and a good strategy. The most common Web3 investment options are stocks, cryptos, and NFTs. However, there are also less  popular investment methods you can consider, such as angel investing or buying into the IDO  (Initial DEX Offering) or ICO (Initial Coin Offering) of a crypto company. In both methods, you  invest in a company by participating in a seed round or buying its coin before launch. One thing to note is that most of Web3 investing is based on narratives: investors spreading the  word on what a company is doing to grow the Web3 ecosystem. However, you shouldn’t depend on  narratives when making decisions. That’s because some Web3 influencers push a good narrative about a  project to get people to buy into the project, and then they end up dumping the project.",1235,218,308.75

Currently, Meta is building two Metaverses: Horizon Worlds and Workplace, for gaming  and co-working, respectively. Apple (APPL): Apple is planning to launch augmented reality (AR)  glasses to help people experience the Metaverse better and might even let users install third-party  apps in a bid to encourage Web3 adoption.

It is a decentralized version of the internet that promises to help users better control their data usage and sharing while enhancing monetization and reducing exposure to data manipulation. The concept of Web3 is not to make our current internet obsolete; it’s to integrate these technologies into the existing infrastructure, allowing everyone to freely use the internet. For example, if you make a Facebook or Instagram post that goes against Meta’s community standards, the social media giant could take the post down or ban your account. This would likely be impossible in Web 3.0 since most platforms will be decentralized. Although it is still a work in progress, many individuals, companies, and even governments have started to position themselves adequately for web3. The Hong Kong government is preparing to adopt a framework for integrating this technology into many of its city's processes. Since Gavin Wood coined the term in 2014, Web3 has grown to offer potential for diverse opportunities.

Without a huge risk appetite, you could prematurely sell your investments and make constant losses. High Capital To make tangible returns on your Web 3.0 investment, you need to put in a significant sum of money. Since it is recommended that you use not more than 10% of your entire portfolio to make Web3 investments, you need to have a diversified portfolio that is not fully reliant on this investment class.

The essence of the chapter remains the same. The previous chapter gave us perspective on how a company evolves from the idea generation stage until it decides to file for an IPO. The idea behind creating the fictional story in the previous chapter was to give you a sense of how a business matures over time. Of course, many nuances were intentionally overlooked to drive the point across, and I hope that helped. The emphasis was on the different stages of business and funding options available at various stages of business.

-3,"5.2 – Why do companies go public?We closed the previous chapter with a few unanswered questions: Why did the company decide to file for an IPO, and in general, why do companies go public?When a company decides to file for an IPO, one of the main reasons is to raise funds to fuel its CAPEX requirement. Apart from this, there are several other reasons for an IPO, sometimes, a company raises funds via IPO to reduce a high-cost debt, or sometimes a company can IPO to give an exit for an early-stage investor. Here is something interesting you can do. Think about a company that went IPO recently, and google for the IPO reason, and you’ll know why the company went public. The promoter has three advantages in taking his company public – Raise funds to meet CAPEX requirement Avoid the need to raise debt which means there are no finance charges to pay, which further translates to better profitability. The promoter can spread the risk amongst a large group of investors instead of one large investor. 100s and thousands of retail investors are better than one large private equity investor. There are other advantages as well in filing for an IPO – Provide an exit for early investors – Once the company goes public, the shares of the company start trading publicly.",1269,223,317.25
-3,"Any existing company shareholders– promoters, angel investors, venture capitalists, or PE funds; can use this opportunity to sell their shares in the open market. By selling their shares, they get an exit on their initial investment in the company. Of course, there is a lock-in period before which early investors cant exit, but that is beside the point. Reward employees –Employees, working for the company would have shares allotted to them as an incentive. This arrangement between the employee and the company is called the “Employee Stock Option” or ESOPS. The shares are allotted at a discount to the employees. Once the company goes public, the employees can see capital appreciation in the shares. A few examples where the employee benefited from ESOP would be Google, Infosys, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, etc Improve visibility – Going public increases visibility as the company is publicly held and traded.

The merchant banker takes up the remaining shares if the subscription is above a defined threshold but is not subscribed fully.

For example, if the price band is between Rs.100 and Rs.120, the public can choose a price they think is fair enough for the IPO issue.

S. Mid Cap Index (CRSPMI1) Russell Midcap Index (RMCC) Dow Jones U. S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index (DWM) S&P MidCap 400 Index (SP400) Unlike the large-cap universe, there is no clear index leader for mid-caps and the four indexes listed above vary quit g than large-cap investing. Understanding which index to use as a benchmark for a particular investment is importan derperforming. Below, we look at the four mid-cap indexes listed above in more detail in order to give investors a be of mid-cap investments. Key Takeaways A mid-cap stock is a stock whose market cap is generally between $2 billion and $10 billion. There are four different m Index, the Dow Jones U. S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index, and the S&P MidCap 400 Index. These indexes differ wi e among investors that the S&P 500 does with large-cap indexes. This means investors need to be aware of the best i p holdings.

Index Sector Breakdown  Each of the four major mid-cap indexes uses slightly different breakdowns of the major market  sectors. For example, DWM uses a ""Consumer Services"" sector and a ""Consumer Goods"" sector instead  of the more traditional ""Consumer Discretionary"" and ""Consumer Staples"" sectors. It also calls its  ""Energy"" sector ""Oil & Gas,"" and does not have a separate ""REITs/Real Estate"" sector. DWM and  CRSPMI1 both use the old ""Telecommunications"" sector classification, which was replaced by  ""Communication Services"" in 2018.6 The rest of the differences in classification are minor, with a slightly different name such as  ""Materials"" instead of the traditional ""Basic Materials.""Where there are differences in the naming  of sectors used by the different indexes, we have indicated those differences in the corresponding  cell within the table below. Also, take note that data for the sector breakdown was not available  for RMCC and so the sector classification used by the iShares Russell Mid-Cap ETF (IWR), which  tracks RMCC, was used instead as a proxy.

Mid-Cap Indexes Analyzed: Defining a Mid-Cap  Based on the four mid-cap indexes analyzed above, it's evident that ""mid-cap"" is a market-cap  classification with flexible boundaries. None of the indexes sticks to the traditional market-cap  range of between $2 billion and $10 billion. Nor do they contain the same number of constituents,  with RMCC being the largest outlier at 824 total stocks.7 There are also significant differences in  the sector breakdowns for each index. This should also help illustrate that, though market  capitalization is an important factor when analyzing stocks, the dividing lines between the size  categories companies are placed in are ultimately arbitrary. The index that most closely follows the traditional market-cap range is S&P 400. Its largest and  smallest market cap are still outside the spectrum, but its range is the tightest compared to the  other three indexes. S&P 400's range is from a low of $1.6 billion to a high of $17.3 billion. S&P  400's median and mean market caps are also somewhat close to the middle of the traditional  classification range. In terms of sector breakdowns, S&P 400 gives a relatively high weighting  toward industrials, at 18.7%, compared to CRSPMI1 and RMCC.",1764,287,441.0
8,"However, that weighting is lower than  the weighting for industrials used by DWM.8 The only other index for which the mean and median fall within the traditional range is DWM. Its  mean and median market cap fall just below the upper boundary at $9.1 billion and $8.0 billion,  respectively. However, the stock with the largest market cap within DWM is well above that upper  boundary, with a market cap of $40.0 billion. DWM is also the index that has the stock with the  smallest market cap at $40.9 million. Considering sector breakdowns, DWM is notable for its  extremely large weightings toward financials and industrials, at 24.0% and 20.9%, respectively.9 RMCC has the stock with the largest market cap, at $61.4 billion. That probably helps to explain  why the mean market cap of RMCC is $24.0 billion, more than double the upper boundary of a mid-cap  stock's market-cap range.7 However, using IWR as a proxy (because data was not available for RMCC), the weight of its largest",986,174,246.5
9,"constituent, as well as the combined weight of the top 10 constituents, is the lowest out of all  the indexes. RMCC (again using IWR as its proxy) gives the largest sector weightings for  information technology and healthcare compared to the other indexes. Information technology is the  sector that receives the largest weighting within the index.10 That skewing toward large-caps is most evident in CRSPMI1. The weight of its top 10 constituents is  6.7%, which represents the largest weighting out of all four indexes. To be sure, the $51.0 billion  market cap of CRSPMI1's largest market-cap stock is lower than that of the RMCC, which is $61.4  billion, as mentioned. But both the mean and median market caps of CRSPMI1 are far above the  traditional range for a mid-cap stock, at $18.2 billion and $19.0 billion, respectively. CRSPMI1  gives the largest weighting to utilities compared to the other three indexes. But the sector that  receives the largest weighting by far in the index is information technology.11  The Bottom Line  Investors have four main indexes from which to choose a benchmark for gauging the performance of  their mid-cap holdings. None of the indexes is more dominant than the others because each of them  is tracked by some of the biggest mid-cap ETFs. They also have unique characteristics, so they are  not interchangeable.",1356,234,339.0
9,"Each of the indexes includes stocks that are not traditionally considered  mid-caps, with a few of the indexes actually having mean and median market caps significantly above  the upper boundary of the traditional mid-cap range. So though market cap is an important metric for investors to consider when looking at stocks, the  boundaries of categories like ""mid-cap"" and ""large-cap"" are ultimately arbitrary, so that should be  kept in mind. This is particularly clear in the mid-cap space where all four indexes vary widely in  terms of their average market cap. The four indexes also vary both in their number of holdings and  sector allocations. Investors should weigh all of these factors when choosing the index that meets  their personal investing needs, taking into consideration their risk tolerance and their individual  financial goals.9.1 – Trading Terminal Over the last few chapters, we have understood several things related to the stock markets. It is time for us to figure out how one can actually transact in the stock markets. There are three options available for you to place a transaction in the stock market – Call your stocks broker (usually on the central support number), and request to buy or sell a stock; this is called “Call & Trade.”Use a web application Use a mobile application Regardless of which method you choose, the selected method gives you access to the stock market. Think of this access as a gateway.",1442,245,360.5
9,"The gateway allows you to do multiple things, such as transact in shares, track your Profit & Loss, track market movements, manage your funds, view stock charts, access trading tools, etc. This chapter aims to familiarize you with this gateway, also called a ‘Trading terminal’. To explain this chapter, I’ll use Zerodha’s trading terminal called ‘Kite.’If you are with another broker, then the trading terminal provided to you will have (should have) similar features and functionality. You can access the trading terminal by entering the URL on your browser. For Zerodha Kite, it is kite.zerodha.com. To access the trading terminal, you must have a trading account with your broker. A good trading terminal offers many features. We will start by understanding a few basic features.",783,125,195.75
10,"Let us set two basic tasks, and we will accomplish them using the trading terminal, and in the process, we learn the basics practically. Here are the two tasks – Buy one share of ITC, and Track the price of Infosys While we achieve the above two tasks, we will also learn about all the relevant concepts.9.2 – The login process The trading terminal is quite sensitive as it contains information about all your securities and funds. SEBI has been working hard to ensure the relevant regulations are in place to prevent situations where access to the client’s trading terminal is compromised. To ensure adequate security, brokers have to follow a stringent login process. The process involves entering your broker-provided user ID (it’s referred to as the Kite ID in Zerodha), and a password. Once you click login, the user id and password are authenticated, and then you are prompted to enter an external TOTP (Time based one-time password). TOTPs, as the name suggests, are time sensitive and keep changing once in a few seconds. TOTPs can be set up using 3rd party authentication software like Google authenticator or Authy. Once you validate the TOTP, you will instantly get access to your trading account.",1208,204,302.0
10,"I’d encourage you to read this article to learn about TOTP, the general login process, and the need to safeguard your trading account.9.3 – The Market watch Once you successfully log in to the platform, you must populate the ‘market watch’ with the stocks you are interested in. Think about the market watch as a blank slate. Once the stock is loaded on the market watch, you can easily transact and query information about it. A blank market watch looks like this (this is also the screen that you see once you log in) The 600.2 under equity and 136.75 under commodities indicate my fund balance. So 600 Rupees for Equity (to buy and sell stocks), and 136 Rupees to buy commodities. You can add funds from your bank to your trading account or withdraw funds from your trading account back to your bank account by clicking on the fund tab on top. Alright, let us work on the first task, i.e., to buy one share of ITC. As a first step, we will load ITC Ltd onto the market watch. To do this, we have to search for ITC in the search bar, and the drop-down will show the stock in different exchanges(NSE/BSE).",1106,204,276.5
10,"You only need to look for ‘ITC’; other instruments, like ITC-BE, ITC-BL, or ITC6, are all different instruments. We will discuss more of that later. We are interested in buying one share of ITC (or ITC stock), and the relevant instrument is ITC. So let us click on the ‘Add symbol’ to add the stock to the Market Watch The Marketwatch will display the last traded price, a percentage change of the stock. The last traded price of the stock (LTP) – This gives us a sense of how much the stock is trading at the very moment. Percentage change – This indicates the percentage change in the LTP with respect to the previous day’s close. Some basic information that will be needed at this point would be: The previous day’s close – As the name suggests, it’s the previous day’s close price. OHLC – Open, High, Low, and Close give us a sense of the range within which the stock is trading during the day. Do Volumes – Gives a sense of how many shares are being traded at a particular time. You can find this information under Market Depth.",1033,191,258.25
10,"If you hover over the stock name from the left, you will find Buy, Sell, Market Depth, and chart options. If you click on Marketdepth, you will find the above information, including the best bid and offer price ladder. We will cover the Bid and Offer prices soon.",263,48,65.75
11,"As you can see, the last traded price of ITC is Rs.262.25, and it is trading -0.40% lower than the previous day’s close, which was Rs.263.30. The open for the day was at Rs.265.90, the highest price and the lowest price at which the stock traded for the day was Rs.265.90 and Rs.262.15 respectively. The volume for the day is close to 27 lakh shares.9.4 – Buying stock through the trading terminal Our goal is to buy one share of ITC. We now have ITC in our trading terminal. The first step for this process would be to invoke what is called a buy order form. Hover over the stock you want to Buy and click on the Buy Icon (B) Clicking on the Buy icon invokes the buy order form, as seen below The order form is pre-populated with some information like the price and quantity. We need to modify this as per our requirements. Let us begin with the first drop-down option on the top. By default, the exchange specified would be NSE, but you can select BSE if you wish.",966,183,241.5
11,"The next entry is the ‘order type.’By clicking on the drop-down menu, you will see the following four options: Limit Market SL SL-Market Let us understand what these options mean. You can opt for a ‘Limit’ order when you are particular about the price you want to pay for a stock. In our case, the last traded price of ITC is Rs.262.25 but say we want to limit our buy price to Rs.261, twenty-five paisa lower than the LTP. In such a situation, I can use the limit feature and specify the price at which I want to buy the stock. The limit feature is great as it gives us control over the price at which we want to buy, but on the flip side, if the stock price does not fall to our limit price, i.e., 261, our order will not get executed, and we won’t get to buy. This is one of the drawbacks of a limit order. The limit order stays valid till the market closes, i.e., 3:30 PM, and then gets canceled. You can also opt for a market order when you intend to buy at market-available prices instead of a limited price.",1014,197,253.5
11,"So if you were to place a market order, as long as sellers are available, your order would go through, and ITC will be bought in and around Rs.262.25. Suppose the price goes up to Rs.265 coinciding with your market order placement, then you will get ITC at Rs.265. When you place a market order, you will never be sure of the price at which you will transact, which could be quite dangerous if you are an active trader. A market order will always ensure your order goes through, unlike a limit order. A stop-loss order protects you from an adverse movement in the market after initiating a position. Suppose you buy ITC at Rs.262.25 with an expectation that ITC will hit Rs.275 shortly. But instead, what if the price of ITC starts going down?We can protect our position by defining the worst possible loss you are willing to take. For instance, in the example, let us assume you don’t want to take a loss beyond Rs.255 This means you have gone long on ITC at Rs.262.25, and the maximum loss you will take on this trade is Rs.6 (255).",1034,190,258.5
11,"If the stock price drops to Rs.255, the stop loss order gets active and hits the exchange, and you will be out of the loss-making position. If the price is above 255, the stop-loss order will be dormant.",203,38,50.75
12,"A stop-loss order is a passive order. To activate it, we need to enter a trigger price. A trigger price, usually above the stop-loss price, acts as a price threshold, and only after crossing this price does the stop-loss order transition from a passive order to an active order. Going with the above example: We are long at Rs.261. If the trade goes bad, we want to get rid of the position at Rs.255. Therefore 255 is the stop-loss price. The trigger price is specified so the stop-loss order would transition from passive to active. The trigger price has to be higher (or equal) to the stop-loss price. We can set this to Rs.255 or higher. If the price drops below 255, the stop loss order gets active.",703,128,175.75
12,"Returning to the main buy order entry form, we move directly to the quantity once the order type is selected. Remember the task is to buy one share of ITC; hence we enter 1 in the quantity box. We ignore the trigger price and disclosed quantity for now. The next thing to select is the product type. Select CNC for delivery trades. If you intend to buy and hold the shares for multiple days/months/ years, you must ensure the shares reside in your Demat account. Selecting CNC is your way of communicating this to your broker. Select MIS if you want to trade intraday. MIS is a margin product; we will understand more about this when we take up the derivatives module. Once these details are filled in your order form, the order is good to hit the markets.",756,139,189.0
12,"The order gets transmitted to the exchange as soon as you press the submit button on the order form. A unique order ticket number is generated against your order. Once the order is sent to the exchange, it will not get executed unless the price hits Rs.261. As soon as the price drops to Rs.261 (assuming sellers are willing to sell one share), your order gets through and is eventually executed. As soon as your order is executed, you will own one share of ITC.9.5 – The order book and Trade book Think of the order book and trade book as online registers within the trading terminal. The order book keeps track of all the orders you have sent to the exchange, and the trade book tracks all the trades. Think of it this way – when you order goods on Amazon, you first add items to the cart. The cart is the order book. You can add items, delete, or modify the order from the cart (order book).",894,169,223.5
12,"But when you press the buy button on Amazon, the order gets placed, and a receipt is generated. The trade book is that receipt. You also get a detailed receipt emailed to you called a ‘Contract Note’; we will discuss that later; for now think about the trade book as a general receipt for all the trades you carry out on the terminal. So the order book has all the details regarding your order. You can navigate to the order book by clicking the Orders tab. The order book provides the details of the orders you have placed. You should access the order book to: Double-check the order details – quantity, price, order type, product type Modify the orders – For example, if you want to modify the buy order, say from 261 to 259. Check Status – After placing the order, you can check the status. The status would state open if the order is completed partially, it would state completed if the order has been completed, and it would state rejected if your order has been rejected. You can also see the details of the rejection in the order book.",1042,192,260.5
13,"If you notice, there is an open order to buy one share of ITC at Rs.261. If you hover over the pending orders, you can find the option to modify or cancel the order. By clicking ‘modify,’ the order form will be invoked, and you can make the desired changes to the order. Once the order is processed, and the trade has been executed, the trade details will be available in the trade book.

At this price, four shares a s Rs.3295, at which eight shares are available, and two sellers offer this. So on and so forth. As you notice, the higher the asking price, the lower the priority.

Mid-cap (or mid-capitalization) is the term that is used to designate companies with a market cap  (capitalization)—or market value—between $2 and $10 billion. As the name implies, a mid-cap company  falls in the middle between large-cap (or big-cap) and small-cap companies. Classifications, such  as large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap are approximations of a company's current value; as such, they  may change over time. Key Takeaways Mid-cap is the term given to companies with a market cap (capitalization)—or market value—between $2 billion and $10 billion. For companies, some of the appealing features of mid-cap companies are that they are expected to grow and increase profits, market share.",1167,182,291.75
100,and productivity; they are in the middle of their growth curve. Mid-cap stocks are useful in portfolio diversification because they provide a balance of growth and stability. Understanding Mid-Cap  There are two main ways a company can raise capital when it's needed: through debt or equity. Debt  must be paid back but can generally be borrowed at a lower rate than equity (due to tax,385,67,96.25
101,"advantages). Equity may cost more, but it does not need to be paid back in times of crisis. As a  result, companies strive to strike a balance between debt and equity. This balance is referred to  as a firm's capital structure. Capital structure, especially equity capital structure, can tell  investors a lot about the growth prospects for a company. One way to gain insight about a company's capital structure and market depth is by calculating its  market capitalization. Companies with low market capitalization, also referred to as small-caps,  have $2 billion or less in market capitalization. Large-capitalization firms have over $10 billion  in market capitalization, and mid-cap firms fall somewhere in between these two categories (ranging  from $2 billion to $10 billion in market capitalization). Additional categories such as mega-cap  (over $200 billion), micro-cap ($50 million to $500 million) and nano-cap (less than $50 million)  have been added to the spectrum of market capitalization for the sake of clarity. For investors, a mid-cap company may be appealing because they are expected to grow and increase in  profits, market share, and productivity; they are in the middle of their growth curve.",1217,200,304.25
101,"Since they  are still considered to be in a growth stage, they are deemed to be less risky than small-caps, but  more risky than large-caps. Successful mid-cap companies run the risk of seeing their market  capitalization rise, mainly due to an increase in their share prices, to the point where they fall  out of the 'mid-cap' category. While a company's market cap depends on market price, a company with a stock priced above $10 is  not necessarily a mid-cap stock. To calculate market capitalization, analysts multiply the current  market price by the current number of shares outstanding. For example, if company A has 10 billion  shares outstanding at a price of $1, it has a market capitalization of $10 billion. If company B  has one billion shares outstanding at a price of $5, company B has a market capitalization of $5  billion. Even though company A has a lower stock price, it has a higher market capitalization than   company B. Company B may have the higher stock price, but it has one-tenth of the shares  outstanding. Advantages of Mid-Caps  Most financial advisors suggest that the key to minimizing risk is a well-diversified portfolio;  investors should have a mix of small-, mid- and large-cap stocks. However, some investors see  mid-cap stocks as a way to diversify risk, as well. Small-cap stocks offer the most growth  potential, but that growth comes with the most risk.",1397,249,349.25
101,"Large-cap stocks offer the most stability, but  they offer lower growth prospects. Mid-cap stocks represent a hybrid of the two, providing a  balance of growth and stability. No one can accurately predict when the market will favor a specific kind of company, whether it’s a  large-, mid- or small-cap. So it’s important to diversify your portfolio, as we mentioned above. But the percentage of mid-caps that you’ll want to invest in depends on your specific goals and  risk tolerance. However, there are many advantages to mid-cap companies that investors may want to consider. When  interest rates are low and capital is cheap, corporate growth is generally stable. Mid-cap  companies typically can get the credit they need in order to grow, and they do well during the  expansion part of the business cycle.",810,139,202.5
102,"Mid-caps are not as risky as small-cap companies, which means they tend to do relatively well  financially during times of economic turbulence. In addition, many mid-caps are well known, are  often focused on one specific business, and have been around long enough to make a niche in their  target market. And finally, because they are riskier than large caps, they may have a higher  return, which could be more appealing to a less risk averse investor's bottom line. Investor's can either buy a mid-cap company's stock directly or buy a mid-cap mutual fund—an  investment vehicle that focuses on mid-cap companies.7.1 – Overview If I were to ask you to give me a real-time summary of the traffic situation in your city, how would you possibly do it?Your city may have thousands of roads and junctions; it is unlikely you would check every road in the city to find the answer. The wiser thing for you to do would be to quickly check a few important roads and junctions across the city’s four directions and observe how the traffic is moving. If you observe chaotic conditions across these roads, you can conclude the traffic situation is chaotic; else, traffic can be considered normal. The few important roads and junctions you tracked to summarize the traffic situation served as a barometer for the entire city’s traffic situation!Drawing parallels, if I were to ask you how the stock market is moving today, how would you answer my question?",1446,250,361.5
102,"There are approximately 5,000 listed companies on the Bombay Stock Exchange and about 2, 000 on the National Stock Exchange. It would be clumsy to check every company, figure out if they are up or down for the day, and then give a detailed answer. Instead, you would check a few important companies across key industrial sectors. If a majority of these companies are moving up, you would say markets are up; if the majority are down, you would say markets are down; and if there is a mixed trend, you would say markets are sideways or flat for the day. So essentially, identify a few companies to represent the broader markets. Whenever someone asks you how the markets are doing, you check the general trend of these selected stocks and then answer. These companies that you have identified collectively make up the stock market index!7.2 – The Index Luckily you need not track these selected companies individually to get a sense of how the markets are doing. The important companies are pre-packaged and continuously monitored to give you this information. This pre-packaged market sentiment indicator is called the ‘Stock market Index.’",1140,192,285.0
102,"There are a few important indices in India. The S&P BSE Sensex represents the Bombay stock exchange, and the Nifty 50 represents the National Stock exchange. Apart from these two, there is the Nifty Bank Index (Bank Nifty), which is quite popular. Bank Nifty represents the banking sector as a whole. S&P stands for Standard and Poor’s, a global credit rating agency. S&P has the technical expertise in constructing the index they have licensed to the BSE. Hence the index also carries the S&P tag. NSE itself maintains the indices via a related company called NSE Indices Limited. Nifty 50 consists of the most frequently traded stocks on the National Stock Exchange; we will soon discuss the methodology basis on which these indices are constructed. An ideal index gives us an updated, accurate representation of the market sentiment.",836,138,209.0
102,"The movements in the Index reflect the changing expectations of the market participants. When the index goes up, it is because the market participants think the future will be better. The index drops if the market participants perceive the future pessimistically.7.3 – Practical uses of the Index Some of the practical uses of Index are discussed below. Information – The index reflects the overall sentiment and trend in the market. The index broadly represents the country’s state of the economy. A stock market index that is up indicates people are optimistic about the future. Likewise, people are pessimistic about the future when the stock market index is down. For example, the Nifty 50 value as of 21st November 2022 is 18150, but around six months ago, the Nifty 50 was at 15820. The index has moved 2300 points or about 14.75% higher in six months,",858,145,214.5
103,"indicating bullishness in the market. In other words, market participants have been optimistic about the Indian economic future. The time frame for calculating the index can be for anything. For example, the Index at 9:30 AM on 21st November was 18140, but an hour later, it moved to 18099. A drop of nearly 40 within an hour. Such movement indicates that the market participants are not enthusiastic from a short-term perspective. Benchmarking – A yardstick to measure the performance is required for all the trading or investing activity people do. Assume over the last year, you invested Rs.100,000/- and generated Rs.20,000 return to make your total corpus Rs.120,000/-. How do you think you performed?Well, on the face of it, a 20% return looks great.",756,124,189.0
103,"However, what if Nifty moved to 30% during the same year?Well, suddenly, it may seem to you that you have underperformed in the market!Usually, the objective of market participants is to outperform the Index. Now, if not for the Index, you can’t figure out how you performed in the stock market. It would be best if you had the index to benchmark the performance. Trading – Trading on the index is probably one of the most popular uses of the index. Majority of the traders in the market trade the index. They take a broader call on the economy or general state of affairs and translate that into a trade. The trader usually takes a short-term call on the index to trade. For example, imagine this situation.",708,127,177.0
103,"At 10:30 AM, the Finance Minister is expected to deliver the budget speech. An hour before the announcement Nifty index is at 18,150 points. You expect the budget to be favorable to the nation’s economy. What do you think will happen to the index? Naturally, the index will move up. So to trade your point of view, you may want to buy the index at 18,150. After all, the index is the representation of the broader economy. So as per your expectation, the budget is good, and the index moves to 18,450. You can now book your profits and exit the trade at a 300 points profit! Trades such as these are possible through what is known as the ‘Derivative’ segment of the markets.",674,124,168.5
103,"We are probably a bit early to explore derivatives, but for now, do remember that index trading is possible through the derivative markets. Portfolio Hedging – Investors usually build a portfolio of stocks. A typical portfolio contains 15 – 20 held for the long term. While the stocks are held from a long-term perspective, they could foresee a prolonged adverse movement in the market (ex-2008), potentially eroding the capital in the portfolio. Investors can use the index to hedge the portfolio in such a situation. We will explore this topic in a futures trading module.7.4 – Index construction methodology Knowing how the index is constructed is important, especially if one wants to advance as an index trader. As we discussed, the Index is a composition of many stocks from different sectors representing the economy’s state. To include a stock in the index, it should qualify for certain criteria. Once qualified as an index stock, it should continue to qualify on the stated criteria.",993,163,248.25
103,"If it fails to maintain the criteria, the stock gets replaced by another stock that qualifies the prerequisites. Based on the selection procedure, the list of stocks is populated. Each stock in the index should be assigned a certain weightage. Weightage, in simpler terms, defines how much importance a certain stock in the index gets compared to the others. For example, if ITC Limited has a 3.85% weightage in the Nifty 50 index, it is as good as saying that 3.85% of Nifty’s movement can be attributed to ITC. You can check the weights of all index stocks here. The obvious question is – How do we assign weights to the stock that make up the Index?There are many ways to assign weights, but the Indian stock exchange follows a free-float market capitalization method. The weights are assigned based on the company’s free-float market capitalization. The larger the market capitalization, the higher the weight.",914,154,228.5
103,"Free float market capitalization is the product of the total number of shares outstanding in the market and the stock price. For example, company ABC has 100 shares outstanding in the market, and the stock price is at 50, then the free-float market cap of ABC is 100*50 = Rs.5,000.

105,"10 Axis Bank Ltd Bank 3.0 As you can see, Reliance Industries Ltd has the highest weightage. This means the Nifty index is most sensitive to price changes in Reliance.7.5 – Sector-specific indices While the Sensex and Nifty represent the broader markets, certain indices represent specific sectors. These are called sectoral indices. For example, the Bank Nifty on NSE represents the mood specific to the banking industry. The CNX IT on NSE represents the behavior of all the IT stocks in the stock markets. Both BSE and NSE have sector-specific indexes. The construction and maintenance of these indices are similar to the other major indices. Key takeaways from this chapter An index acts as a barometer of the whole economy. An index going up indicates that the market participants are optimistic.",800,131,200.0
105,"An index going down indicates that the market participants are pessimistic. There are two main indices in India – The BSE Sensex and NSE’s Nifty 50 An index can be used for various purposes – information, benchmarking, trading and hedging.

107,"What Is the S&P 500 Index?  The S&P 500 Index, or Standard & Poor's 500 Index, is a market-capitalization-weighted index of 500  leading publicly traded companies in the U. S. The index actually has 503 components because three  of them have two share classes listed. It is not an exact list of the top 500 U. S. companies by market cap because there are other  criteria that the index includes. Still, the S&P 500 index is regarded as one of the best gauges of  prominent American equities' performance, and by extension, that of the stock market overall. Key Takeaways The S&P 500 Index features 500 leading U. S. publicly traded companies, with a primary emphasis on market capitalization. The S&P 500 Index was launched in 1957 by the credit rating agency Standard and Poor's. The S&P is a float-weighted index, meaning the market capitalizations of the companies in the index are adjusted by the number of shares available for public trading. Because of its depth and diversity, the S&P 500 is widely considered one of the best gauges of large U. S. stocks, and even the entire equities market. You can't directly invest in the S&P 500 because it's an index, but you can invest in one of the many funds that use it as a benchmark, tracking its composition and performance.   Investopedia / Julie Bang  Weighting Formula and Calculation of the S&P 500  The S&P 500 uses a market-cap weighting method, giving a higher percentage allocation to companies  with the largest market capitalizations.1 Company Weighting in S & P=Company market capTotal of all market caps\text{Company Weighting in S \& P}= \frac{\text{Company market cap}}{\text{Total of all market caps}}Company Weighting in S & P=Total of all market capsCompany market cap​ Determining the weighting of each component of the S&P 500 begins with adding up the total market cap for the index by adding together the market cap of every company in the index.",1920,332,480.0
107,"To review, the market cap of a company is calculated by taking the current stock price and multiplying it by the company's outstanding shares. Fortunately, the total market cap for the S&P 500 as well as the market caps of individual companies are published frequently on financial websites, saving investors the need to calculate them. The weighting of each company in the index is calculated by taking the company's market cap and dividing it by the total market cap of the index.2  Other S&P Indices  The S&P 500 is a part of the S&P Global 1200 family of indices. Other indices included are the S&P  MidCap 400, which represents the mid-cap range of companies, and the S&P SmallCap 600, which  represents small-cap companies. The S&P 500, S&P MidCap 400, and S&P SmallCap 600 combine to cover  90% of all U. S. capitalization in an index known as the S&P Composite 1500.34 Take the Next Step to Invest Advertiser Disclosure",927,164,231.75

Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace. S&P 500 Index Construction  The S&P only uses free-floating shares when calculating market cap, meaning the shares that the  public can trade. The S&P adjusts each company's market cap to compensate for new share issues or  company mergers. The value of the index is calculated by totaling the adjusted market caps of each  company and dividing the result by a divisor. The divisor is proprietary information of the S&P and  is not released to the public. The S&P Index (SPX) is not a total return index and does not include  cash dividend gains for the companies listed.5 However, you can calculate a company's weighting in the index, which can provide investors with  valuable information. If a stock rises or falls, you can get a sense as to whether it might have an  impact on the overall index. For example, a company with a 10% weighting will have a greater impact  on the value of the index than a company with a 2% weighting.",1170,206,292.5
108,"The S&P 500 is one of the most widely quoted American indexes because it represents the largest  publicly traded corporations in the U. S. The S&P 500 focuses on the U. S. market's large-cap sector  and is also a float-weighted index (a type of capitalization weighting), meaning company market  caps are adjusted by the number of shares available for public trading.1 The S&P 500's most recent rebalancing was announced on Sep. 1, 2023, and took effect before markets opened on Sept. 18, 2023. Blackstone Inc. and Airbnb Inc. replaced Lincoln National Corp. and Newell Brands Inc., respectively.6  S&P 500 Competitors   S&P 500 vs. Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)  Another common U. S. stock market benchmark is the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). The S&P 500  is often the institutional investor's preferred index given its depth and breadth, while the DJIA  has historically been associated with significant equities from the retail investor's point of  view. Institutional investors perceive the S&P 500 as more representative of U. S. equity  markets because it comprises more stocks across all sectors (500 versus the Dow's 30). Furthermore, the S&P 500 uses a market-cap weighting method, giving a higher percentage allocation  to companies with the largest market caps, while the DJIA is a price-weighted index that gives  companies with higher stock prices a higher index weighting. The market-cap-weighted structure  tends to be more common than the price-weighted across U. S. indexes.7  S&P 500 vs. Nasdaq  Nasdaq is a global electronic marketplace for trading securities. There are several equity market  indexes that include stocks traded on Nasdaq. Note that a given stock included in the S&P 500 Index  may also be in one or more of the various Nasdaq indexes. Among the most-watched Nasdaq stock indices are the: Nasdaq 100 Index, which includes 100 of the largest, most actively traded common equities listed on Nasdaq.",1946,326,486.5
109,"Nasdaq Composite Index, which the media often simply refers to as the Nasdaq (and which includes more than 2,500 common stocks that trade on Nasdaq). Nasdaq Global Equity Index (NQGI), which includes international stocks. PHLX Semiconductor Sector Index (SOX), which is the leading barometer of stocks related to the semiconductor industry. OMX Stockholm 30 Index (OMXS30), which includes 30 actively traded stocks on the Stockholm Stock Exchange.8  S&P 500 vs. Russell Indexes  The S&P 500 is a member of a set of indexes created by Standard & Poor's. The Standard & Poor's set  of indexes is like the Russell index family in that both are market-cap-weighted indexes unless  stated otherwise (as in the case of equal-weighted indexes, for example). However, there are two large differences between the construction of the S&P and Russell families  of indexes. First, Standard & Poor's chooses constituent companies via a committee, while Russell  indexes use a formula to choose stocks to include. Second, there is no name overlap within S&P  style indices (growth versus value), while Russell indexes will include the same company in both  the value and growth style indexes.9101112  S&P 500 vs. Vanguard 500 Fund  The Vanguard 500 Index Fund seeks to track the price and yield performance of the S&P 500 Index by  investing its total net assets in the stocks comprising the index and holding each component with  approximately the same weight as the S&P index. In this way, the fund barely deviates from the S&P,  which it is designed to mimic.13 The S&P 500 is an index, so it can't be traded directly. Those who want to invest in the companies that comprise the S&P must invest in a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that tracks the index, such as the Vanguard 500 ETF (VOO).",1789,309,447.25
109,"Limitations of the S&P 500 Index  One of the limitations of the S&P and other market-cap-weighted indexes arises when stocks in the  index become overvalued, meaning they rise higher than their fundamentals warrant. If a stock has a  heavy weighting in the index while being overvalued, the stock typically inflates the overall value  or price of the index. A company's rising market cap isn't necessarily indicative of a company's fundamentals so much as  it reflects the stock's increase in value relative to shares outstanding. As a result,  equal-weighted indexes have become increasingly popular whereby each company's stock price  movements have an equal impact on the index.1415  Example of the S&P 500 Market Cap Weighting  In order to understand how the underlying stocks affect the S&P index, the individual market  weights must be calculated by dividing the market cap of each company by the total market cap of  the index. Below is an example of Apple's weighting in the index: Apple (AAPL) reported 15.7 billion shares outstanding in its quarterly filing for the period ending July 1, 2023, and had a stock price of $173.93 at the end of the trading day on Sept. 21, 2023.1617 Apple's market cap is $2.7 trillion as of Sept. 21, 2023.18 The S&P 500 total market cap is approximately $39.7 trillion as of Aug. 31, 2023, which is the sum of the market caps for all of the stocks in the index.19 Apple's weighting in the index was approximately 6.8%, or $2.7 trillion divided by $39.7 trillion.",1504,263,376.0
110,"Overall, the larger the market weight of a company, the more impact each 1% change in a stock's  price will have on the index. Note that S&P does not currently provide the total list of all 503  components on its website, outside of the top 10. Why Is It Called Standard and Poor's?The first S&P Index was launched in 1923 as a joint project by the Standard Statistical Bureau and Poor's Publishing. The original index covered 233 companies. The two companies merged in 1941 to become Standard and Poor's.207 Which Companies Qualify for the S&P 500?In order to be included in the S&P 500 Index, a company must be publicly traded and based in the United States. It also needs to meet certain requirements for liquidity and market capitalization, have a public float of at least 10% of its shares, and have positive earnings over the trailing four quarters.1 How Do You Invest in the S&P 500?The simplest way to invest in the S&P 500 Index (or any other stock market index) is to buy shares of an index fund that targets that index. These funds invest in a cross-section of the companies represented on the index, meaning that the fund's performance should mirror the performance of the index itself.",1198,212,299.5
110,"The Bottom Line  The S&P 500 Index is one of the most widely used indexes for the U. S. stock market. These 500  companies represent the largest and most liquid companies in the U. S., from technology and software  companies to banks and manufacturers. Historically, the index has been used to provide insight into  the direction of the stock market. Although the index was created by a private company, the S&P 500  is now a popular yardstick for the performance of the market economy at large. If you are looking to start investing in the market but don’t feel like you have enough money to  buy enough shares to fully diversify your portfolio, fractional shares are a great solution. This  strategy allows you to invest in stocks based on a specific dollar amount rather than buying a  specific number of shares. This allows you to diversify your funds and start investing at a lower  threshold. Buying fractional shares on Webull’s platform is streamlined and easy. You simply open  and fund an account to access fractional shares from an approved list of thousands of stocks and  ETFs.

Once you have opened a Webull account, you can login and  search for the stock or exchange traded fund (ETF) that you’d like to buy fractional shares of. If  fractional share trading is available for that particular stock, there will be a green diamond icon  on the stock. Step 3: Click the “Trade” tab. After deciding on the stock that you’d like to buy and determining  that it can be traded in fractional shares, you will click the “trade” button at the bottom of your  screen.",1056,195,264.0

FAQs  What Are Fractional Shares?Fractional shares allow investors to buy a fraction, or portion, of a whole share of a stock. Investing in fractional shares helps you to easily diversify your portfolio and invest in companies that you may otherwise not be able to easily buy shares of. For instance, if you want to invest in a company, but the stock price is $100 per share, you don’t need to have $100 to buy a full share.",1188,207,297.0
113,"At Webull, you can invest in this company for as little as $5. In this case, your stake in the company will be 0.05 of a full share (5/100). With this strategy, you are investing based on a specific dollar amount that you set, not an individual stock’s price or a certain number of shares. Buying fractional shares provides investors with a lower entry point of accessibility, thereby allowing them to gain market entry sooner into expensive stocks. Moreover, with fractional shares of ETFs,",491,84,122.75

Do Fractional Shares Make You Money?Investing in fractional shares is a good way to dollar-cost average your money into the market. When utilizing this strategy on a regular basis, you will be buying fractions of several stocks over the course of time, which will accumulate into a portfolio that includes full shares of multiple stocks.",1257,197,314.25
114,"Buying shares of a stock over time reduces the effect of market timing where you may be paying a premium or getting a discount on a transaction based on market factors. Lowering the total cost paid for an asset can make you money, provided that the asset appreciates over time. Over time, diversified portfolios are more likely than not to appreciate.

It is also noted on the website that “the rule of $5 minimum doesn't work for closing fractional share positions.”Fractional shares are not able to be transferred, so any fractional share would need to be sold prior to a transfer taking place. What Is Floating Stock?  Floating stock is the number of shares available for trading of a particular stock. Low float  stocks are those with a low number of shares. Floating stock is calculated by subtracting  closely-held shares and restricted stock from a firm’s total outstanding shares.",837,141,209.25
114,"Closely-held shares are those owned by insiders, major shareholders, and employees. Restricted  stock refers to insider shares that cannot be traded because of a temporary restriction, such as  the lock-up period after an initial public offering (IPO). A stock with a small float will generally be more volatile than a stock with a large float. This is  because, with fewer shares available, it may be harder to find a buyer or seller. This results in  larger spreads and often lower volume.",491,85,122.75
115,"Key Takeaways Floating stock refers to the number of shares a company has available to trade in the open market. To calculate a company's floating stock, subtract its restricted stock and closely held shares from its total number of outstanding shares. Floating stock will change over time as new shares may be issued, shares may be bought back, or insiders or major shareholders may buy or sell the stock. Low float stocks tend to have higher spreads and higher volatility than a comparable larger float stock. Investors can find it difficult to enter or exit positions in stocks that have a low float. Understanding Floating Stock  A company may have a large number of shares outstanding, but limited floating stock. For example,  assume a company has 50 million shares outstanding. Of that 50 million shares, large institutions  own 35 million shares, management and insiders own 5 million, and the employee stock ownership plan  (ESOP) holds 2 million shares. Floating stock is therefore only 8 million shares (50 million shares  minus 42 million shares), or 16% of the outstanding shares. The amount of a company’s floating stock may rise or fall over time.",1162,197,290.5
115,"This can occur for a variety  of reasons. For example, a company may sell additional shares to raise more capital, which then  increases the floating stock. If restricted or closely-held shares become available, then the  floating stock will also increase. On the flip side, if a company decides to implement a share buyback, then the number of outstanding  shares will decrease. In this case, the floating shares as a percentage of outstanding stock will  also go down. A stock split will increase floating shares, while a reverse stock split decreases float. Why Floating Stock Is Important  A company's float is an important number for investors because it indicates how many shares are  actually available to be bought and sold by the general investing public. Low float is typically an  impediment to active trading. This lack of trading activity can make it difficult for investors to  enter or exit positions in stocks that have limited float. Institutional investors will often avoid trading in companies with smaller floats because there are  fewer shares to trade, thus leading to limited liquidity and wider bid-ask spreads.",1135,192,283.75
115,"Instead,  institutional investors (such as mutual funds, pension funds, and insurance companies) that buy  large blocks of stock will look to invest in companies with a larger float. If they invest in  companies with a big float, their large purchases will not impact the share price as much. Special Considerations  A company is not responsible for how shares within the float are traded by the public—this is a  function of the secondary market. Therefore, shares that are purchased, sold, or even shorted by  investors do not affect the float because these actions do not represent a change in the number of  shares available for trade. They simply represent a redistribution of shares. Similarly, the  creation and trading of options on a stock do not affect the float. Example of Floating Stock  As of September 2023, General Electric (GE) had 1.088 billion shares outstanding.1 Of this, 0.20%  were held by insiders and 75.81% were held by large institutions.2 Therefore, a total of 76% or 830  million shares were likely not available for public trading. The floating stock is therefore about  260 million shares (1.088 billion - 830 million). It is important to note that institutions don't hold a stock forever. The institutional ownership",1248,214,312.0
116,"number will change regularly, although not always by a significant percentage. Falling  institutional ownership coupled with a falling share price could signal that institutions are  dumping the shares. Increasing institutional ownership shows that institutions are accumulating  shares. Is Floating Stock Good or Bad?Stock float isn't good or bad, but it can affect an investor's decisions. The amount of floating stock a company has—the shares made available to trade—can affect the liquidity of that stock. Stocks with a smaller float tend to have high volatility, while stocks with a larger float tend to have lower volatility. Some investors may prefer stocks with higher float, because it's easier to enter and exit positions for these stocks. What Is Stock Flotation?Stock flotation is when a company issues new shares to the public.",840,132,210.0
116,"It can help the company raise capital. The opposite of stock flotation is a float shrink, such as with stock buybacks: fewer shares are available to trade. What Is the Difference Between Floating and Non-Floating Shares?The floating shares are the shares available to trade, while non-floating shares are those held by shareholders and company insiders and are not available for trading. The Bottom Line  A company's floating stock is the shares it has available to trade on the open market. Traders tend  to prefer stocks with larger floats, as they find it easier to enter and exit a stock that has  greater liquidity. Stocks with larger floats have more shares available, making them more liquid  and easier for investors to buy or sell. The meanings of big-cap and small-cap are generally understood by their names, which indicate how  valuable they are in terms of market capitalization. Big-cap stocks—also referred to as large-cap  stocks—are shares of larger companies. Small-cap stocks, on the other hand, are shares of smaller  companies.",1048,175,262.0
116,"Labels like these can often be misleading because many people run under the assumption that they  can only make money by investing in large-cap stocks. And that can't be further from the  truth—especially nowadays. If you don't realize how big small-cap stocks have become, you could  miss some potentially promising investment opportunities. Small-cap stocks are often attractive due to their lower relative valuations and potential to grow  into big-cap stocks eventually, but the dollar-amount definition of a small-cap has changed over  time. What was once considered a big-cap stock in previous decades may be thought of as a small-cap  stock today. This article will define the caps and provide additional information to help investors  understand terms that are often taken for granted. Key Takeaways Big-cap (large-cap) stocks have a market cap of $10 billion or more. Small-cap stocks generally have a market cap of $250 million to $2 billion. Small-cap stocks shouldn't be overlooked when putting together a diverse portfolio. Big-cap stocks don’t always mean larger returns on investment.",1099,176,274.75
117,"Scaling up Stocks  Before we do anything else, we first need to define the word cap—which is short for capitalization. The term in its entirety, though, is market capitalization or market cap. This is the market's  estimate of the total dollar value of a company's outstanding shares.1 To get this figure, you need to multiply the price of a stock by the number of shares outstanding.1  One thing to keep in mind, though, is that though this is the common conception of market  capitalization, you actually need to add the market value of any of the company's publicly traded  bonds to calculate the total market value of a company. The market cap shows the size of the company, which is something of interest to most investors. That's because it generally points out several of a company's key characteristics, including its  risk assessment. Although the value of small-cap stocks may vary from broker to broker, the general  consensus today is that they have market caps ranging from $250 million to $2 billion.1 One misconception people have about small-caps is that they are startup companies or are just  brand-new entities that are breaking out. But many small-cap companies are just like their larger  counterparts in that they have strong track records, are well established, and have great  financials. And because they are smaller, small-cap share prices have a greater chance of growth.1  This means they have more potential for investors to earn money faster. In general, small-cap stocks are thought to be more volatile than big-cap stocks and thus provide both greater risk but also opportunity. This is because big-cap stocks are often larger, more mature companies that are not seeking aggressive growth.",1721,292,430.25
117,"The Big-Caps  Big-cap stocks refer to the largest publicly traded companies, with market caps of more than $10  billion, like General Electric and Walmart.1 These companies are also called blue-chip  stocks—companies with a history of dependable earnings, solid reputations, and strong financials. Some examples of blue-chip stocks are IBM Corp., Microsoft, Coca-Cola Co., and Boeing Co.2 Though  companies like these tend to perform well and provide safe returns for investors, you should not  see this as a blanket expectation for all large-caps. In general, big-cap stocks are established, mature, and stable. They tend to be less volatile and  reward investors with stable and growing dividend streams. However, some investors have the  misconception that the large-cap moniker means there is no risk at all. There have been several  cases in financial history that point to the opposite. Enron is just one example. It serves to demonstrate that the bigger they are, the harder they fall. The company, which was a darling of the energy industry, was the subject of an accounting scandal. The company used mark to market (MTM) accounting to make the company look like it was much more  profitable than it actually was.",1221,203,305.25

The company  buckled and ended up filing for bankruptcy.3 Key personnel, including CEO Jeffrey Skilling and the company's accounting firm, faced criminal charges.4 The lesson?Just because it's a large-cap doesn't mean it's always a great investment. You still  have to do your research, which means looking at other, smaller companies that can provide you with  a great basis for your overall investment portfolio.",561,89,140.25
118,"Dow vs. Nasdaq: The average market cap for the Dow remains much larger than the average market cap for the Nasdaq 100.56  The Small-Caps  Small-cap stocks, as the name implies, are far smaller in terms of market valuation—but also,  generally, scale, scope, and influence. These companies have a market cap of $250 million to $2  billion and are found in all business types, economic sectors, and growth phases.1 One common misconception about small-caps is that they are startups or brand-new companies. In  reality, many small-cap companies are well-established businesses with strong track records and  great financials. And because they are smaller, small-cap share prices have a greater chance of  growth. Historically, small-cap stocks may have outperformed large-cap stocks.7 However, whether smaller or  larger companies perform better varies over time from period to period based on other factors like  the broader economic climate.8 For instance, big-caps seem to hold their own better during bear  markets and recessions.9 At the same time, small-cap stocks tend to be more volatile (and thus riskier) than their  larger-cap peers. It often takes less trading volume to move their prices, and it is common for a  small-cap stock's price to fluctuate more in a single trading day than those of larger companies. That is something that many investors simply cannot stomach, but it does attract more active  traders like day traders. Note that because these stocks often have less liquidity, it is also more  difficult to exit a position at the market price. Ranking Market Capitalizations  The definitions of big- or large-cap and small-cap stocks differ slightly from one brokerage  company to the next and have changed over time. The differences between the brokerage definitions  are relatively superficial and only matter for the companies that lie on their edges.",1877,310,469.25
118,"The  classifications are important for borderline companies because mutual funds use these definitions  to determine which stocks to buy. The current approximate definitions are as follows: Mega-cap: Market cap of $200 billion and greater10 Big-cap: $10 billion and greater, up to $200 billion Mid-cap: $2 billion to $10 billion Small-cap: $250 million to $2 billion1 Micro-cap: $50 million to $250 million Nano-cap: Under $50 million11 These categories have increased over time along with the market indexes. And it is important to  note that these definitions are fluid and not fixed—they are relative. For example, in several  circles, stocks with market caps greater than $100 billion are seen as mega-caps. Remember market capitalization is based on the stock price and therefore the perceived value of a company, not the actual value.1  Shifting Numbers  The big-cap stocks get most of Wall Street's attention because that's where you'll find the  lucrative investment banking business. Large-cap stocks make up the majority of the equity market",1051,168,262.75
119,"in the United States, which is why they make up the nuclei of many investors' portfolios. Mega-cap stocks, on the other hand, tend to shift in numbers. There were at least 7 of these stocks  in existence in 2007, but that number shrunk by 2010 due to the 2008 mortgage meltdown and the  Great Recession.1213 In the years since, mega-cap stocks have made a resurgence, and behemoths such  as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) have reached historic market-cap highs approaching $2 trillion  each. As of 2022, the total number of mega-cap companies around the world is around 48.14 But what about small-caps?Remember, just because they have a smaller market cap doesn't mean you  won't find value or great returns. In fact, you can find much of the value in the stock market in  small-cap stocks because some of them have some of the strongest track records around. What Are Some Characteristics of Big-Cap Stocks?Aside from having a market capitalization of $10 billion or more, large-cap stocks also tend to be those of older, more mature corporations. These companies may be more likely to pay regular dividends to their shareholders because they see stable, established sources of income and profitability. Large-caps are typically market leaders and household names, many of which are also blue-chip stocks.",1309,220,327.25
119,"What Are Some of the Risks of Investing in Small-Cap Stocks?Small-cap stocks can be great growth opportunities, but investors should also be aware of the risks associated with smaller companies' stocks. First, they tend to be more volatile, meaning that price swings and drawdowns can be larger than with bigger companies' stocks. These shares may also be less liquid and more thinly traded, with larger bid-ask spreads, making it more costly to enter and exit positions. At the company level, smaller companies may have a harder time accessing funding or raising capital than larger companies do. This can be a limiting factor for operations and growth. What Indexes Track Big-Cap Stocks?If you want to invest in big-caps, you can look to index funds or ETFs that track indexes such as the S&P 500 (the 500 largest companies in the U. S.) or the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), which covers 30 blue-chip stocks.15 What Indexes Track Small-Cap Stocks?If you want to invest in small-caps, you can look to index funds or ETFs that track indexes such as the Russell 2000 Index or the S&P Small-Cap 600.1617 Which Are Better: Big-Caps or Small-Caps?This will depend on the type of investor you are.",1199,201,299.75
119,"If you have a greater risk tolerance and longer time horizons, small-cap stocks tend to outperform big-caps over time because they are able to grow more rapidly than larger companies. If you prefer stable appreciation and dividend income, big-caps may be more suitable. In general, investors are encouraged to diversify and hold a mix of stocks containing both large and small companies. The Bottom Line  The big and small labels are also attached to the major stock exchanges and indexes, which also  leads to confusion. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is viewed as consisting of only big-cap  stocks while the Nasdaq is often viewed as being comprised of small-cap stocks. These perceptions  were generally true before 1990, but have since changed. Since the tech boom, the market caps of  the stock exchanges and indexes vary and overlap.",849,143,212.25
120,"Labels such as big and small are subjective, relative, and change over time. Big does not always  mean less risky, but the big-caps are the stocks most closely followed by Wall Street analysts.

Right from the time you log in to a trading terminal (let’s say to buy shares), to the time these shares hit your DEMAT account, market intermediaries work seamlessly together to ensure your transactions flow without any hiccups. These entities play their role quietly behind the scene, always complying with the rules laid out by SEBI and ensuring an effortless and smooth experience for your transactions in the stock market. These entities are generally referred to as Financial Intermediaries or market intermediaries. Together, these financial intermediaries, interdependent on one another, create an ecosystem in which the financial markets operate. Let us quickly review a few of these key market intermediaries and the roles they play in the ecosystem. 3.2 – The Stock Broker The stockbroker is probably one of the most important financial intermediaries you need to know.",1272,203,318.0
120,"A stockbroker is a corporate entity registered as a trading member with the stock exchange and holds a stockbroking license. SEBI grants the license through due diligence, and the broker is expected to comply with the rules prescribed by SEBI. A stockbroker is your gateway to the stock markets to make investments in stocks, bonds, ETFs, and Mutual funds. To transact in the stock market, you must set up (open account) with a stockbroker of your choice. Many stock brokers are registered in India, and you can choose a broker based on personal criteria. A few popular filters based on which people select stockbrokers are – The simplicity of the broker platform The efficiency of the broker’s support system Access to ready reports – Profit & Loss reports, Tradebook, Tax P&L Broker’s net worth (you dont want to deal with a broker who is not profitable or does not have a good P&L) Initiatives like education Once you decide on your broker and open a trading and DEMAT account, you can start transacting in the stock market. After setting up your account, there are a few standard ways to interact with your broker. You can call your broker, identify yourself with your client code (account code) and place an order for your transaction. The dealer at the other end will execute the order for you and confirm the status of the same while you are still on the call. Do it yourself – this is perhaps the most popular way to transact in the markets.",1449,255,362.25
120,"The broker gives you access to the market via a ‘Trading Terminal’. After you log in to the trading terminal, you can view live price quotes from the market and place orders yourself.

Facilitate the fund transfer between your trading and bank account Provide you with a back-office. The back office is a portal to access many reports about your account. Zerodha’s back office is called Console. The broker charges a fee for the services provided, also called the ‘brokerage charge’ or just brokerage. The brokerage rates vary, and it’s up to you to find a broker you think strikes a balance between the brokerage charged and the services provided. 3.3 – Depository and Depository Participants When you buy a property, the only way to identify and claim that you own the property is by producing the property papers. Hence, it becomes essential to keep the property papers safe and secure. Likewise, when you buy a share (a share represents part ownership in a company), the only way to claim ownership is by producing your share certificate. A share certificate is nothing but a document entitling you as the owner of the shares in a company.",1306,223,326.5
121,"Before 1996 the share certificate was in paper format; however, post-1996, the share certificates were converted to digital form. Converting a paper format share certificate into a digital format share certificate is called “Dematerialization,” often abbreviated as DEMAT. Did you know the Harshad Mehta scam of 1992, played a significant role in digitizing the share certificate?I’d suggest you watch the SonyLiv series on the Harshad Mehta saga, it gives you a good perspective of the market’s ecosystem before it went digital. The share certificate in DEMAT format has to be stored digitally. The storage place for the digital share certificate is the ‘DEMAT Account. A Depository is a financial intermediary that offers the Demat account service. Think of the demat account as a digital vault for your shares. As you may have guessed, your broker’s trading account and the DEMAT account from the Depository are interlinked. For example, if your idea is to buy Infosys shares, then all you need to do is open your trading account, look for Infosys’ prices, and buy it.",1071,174,267.75
121,"Once the transaction is complete, the role of your trading account is done. After you buy, the shares of Infosys will automatically get credited to your demat account. Likewise, when you wish to sell Infosys shares, you must log in to your trading account and sell the stock. The act of selling is carried out in your trading account. But in the backend, because your trading account and demat account are linked, the broker debits your demat account of the shares you have sold. At present, only two depositaries offer DEMAT account services. The National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL) and Central Depository Services (India) Limited. There is virtually no difference between the two, and both operate under strict SEBI regulations. You cannot walk into National Stock Exchange’s (NSE) office to open a trading account, likewise, you cannot walk into a Depository (NSDL or CDSL) to open a demat account. To open a demat account, you must speak to a Depository Participant (DP).",985,162,246.25

Zerodha is a depositary participant of Central Depository Services (India) Limited (CDSL). 3.4 – Banks Banks play a straightforward role in the market ecosystem. They help facilitate the fund transfer from your bank account to your trading account. Both the trading account and bank account are linked. Broker’s link these accounts after verifying your bank account. You can link multiple bank accounts to your trading through which you can transfer funds and trade. Irrespective of how many bank accounts you choose to link with your trading account, funds can be withdrawn to only one bank account.",786,132,196.5

You can add funds to all the bank accounts, but withdrawals are only processed to the primary bank account.",294,50,73.5
122,"Also, dividend payments and money from buybacks will be sent to the primary bank account. The primary bank account is connected to your trading account, the Depository, the Registrar, and the transfer agents (RTA). At this stage, you must have realized that the three financial intermediaries operate via three different accounts – a trading account offered by your broker, demat account offered by the depositary participant, and a Bank account offered by a bank.

Mid-Cap Indexes Analyzed: Defining a Mid-Cap  Based on the four mid-cap indexes analyzed above, it's evident that ""mid-cap"" is a market-cap classification with flex market-cap range of between $2 billion and $10 billion. Nor do they contain the same number of constituents, with o significant differences in the sector breakdowns for each index. This should also help illustrate that, though marke the dividing lines between the size categories companies are placed in are ultimately arbitrary. The index that most closely follows the traditional market-cap range is S&P 400. Its largest and smallest market cap ompared to the other three indexes. S&P 400's range is from a low of $1.6 billion to a high of $17.3 billion. S&P 400's ddle of the traditional classification range. In terms of sector breakdowns, S&P 400 gives a relatively high weighting t wever, that weighting is lower than the weighting for industrials used by DWM.8 The only other index for which the mean and median fall within the traditional range is DWM. Its mean and median 8.0 billion, respectively.",1345,218,336.25
166,"However, the stock with the largest market cap within DWM is well above that upper bounda t has the stock with the smallest market cap at $40.9 million. Considering sector breakdowns, DWM is notable for its 24.0% and 20.9%, respectively.9 RMCC has the stock with the largest market cap, at $61.4 billion. That probably helps to explain why the mean mark ry of a mid-cap stock's market-cap range.7 However, using IWR as a proxy (because data was not available for RMCC), the weight of its largest constituent, as w west out of all the indexes. RMCC (again using IWR as its proxy) gives the largest sector weightings for information te tion technology is the sector that receives the largest weighting within the index.10 That skewing toward large-caps is most evident in CRSPMI1. The weight of its top 10 constituents is 6.7%, which rep , the $51.0 billion market cap of CRSPMI1's largest market-cap stock is lower than that of the RMCC, which is $61.4 bi f CRSPMI1 are far above the traditional range for a mid-cap stock, at $18.2 billion and $19.0 billion, respectively. CRS other three indexes. But the sector that receives the largest weighting by far in the index is information technology. The Bottom Line  Investors have four main indexes from which to choose a benchmark for gauging the performance of their mid-cap e each of them is tracked by some of the biggest mid-cap ETFs. They also have unique characteristics, so they are no ot traditionally considered mid-caps, with a few of the indexes actually having mean and median market caps signific So though market cap is an important metric for investors to consider when looking at stocks, the boundaries of cat so that should be kept in mind. This is particularly clear in the mid-cap space where all four indexes vary widely in te oth in their number of holdings and sector allocations.",1849,318,462.25

222,"But too many individual stocks or stock funds might make your portfolio too volatile. Stocks are more volatile than bonds and might increase 20% in one year and decline that amount or more in another.

If you don’t rebalance and restore your assets to the 80% vs. 20% stock/bond mix and stocks become too large a portion of your portfolio, then you might experience a greater loss than you’re comfortable with on occasion.

If you buy enough shares, you can return the funds or individual holdings back to their preferred asset allocation. If you need to withdraw funds from your account, sell the overrepresented asset.

Stocks have returned approximately 10% over the last century, so they'll become a greater percentage of the total portfolio over time without rebalancing.1 Stocks are also riskier and more volatile, so the growing stock allocation of the unbalanced portfolio will lead to higher returns, along with greater volatility. Rebalancing is usually a tradeoff between greater return and lower volatility. How Often Should I Rebalance My Portfolio?Rebalancing too frequently can sacrifice returns. Rebalancing less often can bolster returns and increase portfolio volatility. Vanguard recommends checking your portfolio every six months, and rebalancing if the values drift 5% or more from target.2 There isn’t a perfect rebalancing solution.

Cyclical vs. Non-Cyclical Stocks: An Overview  The terms cyclical and non-cyclical refer to how closely correlated a company's share price is to  the fluctuations of the economy. Cyclical stocks and their companies have a direct relationship to  the economy, while non-cyclical stocks repeatedly outperform the market when economic growth slows. Investors cannot control the cycles of the economy, but they can tailor their investing practices  to its ebb and flow. Adjusting to economic transitions requires an understanding of how industries  relate to the economy. There are fundamental differences between companies that are affected by  broad economic changes and those that are virtually immune to them. Key Takeaways Cyclical stocks are volatile and tend to follow trends in the economy.",1136,187,284.0
223,"Non-cyclical stocks outperform the market during an economic slowdown. Companies of cyclical stocks sell goods and services that many buy when the economy is doing well but cut during downturns, such as luxury goods. Non-cyclical companies sell staple goods like food and clothing and household consumables like soap and toothpaste. Cyclicals tend to go up and down with the economy, while non-cyclical stocks are steady earners in good times and bad. Cyclical Stocks  Cyclical companies follow the trends in the overall economy, which makes their stock prices very  volatile. When the economy grows, prices for cyclical stocks go up. When the economy turns down,  their stock prices will drop. They follow all the cycles of the economy from expansion, peak, and  recession all the way to recovery. Cyclical stocks represent companies that make or sell discretionary items and services that are in  demand when the economy is doing well. They include restaurants, hotel chains, airlines, furniture,  high-end clothing retailers, and automobile manufacturers.",1058,168,264.5
224,"When people delay or stop buying anything dispensable, the revenues of the companies that produce  and sell them fall. This, in turn, puts pressure on their stock prices, which start to drop. In the  event of a long downturn, some of these companies may even go out of business. Investors may find opportunities in cyclical stocks hard to predict because of the correlation they  have to the economy. Since it's hard to predict the ups and downs of the economic cycle, it's  tricky to guess how well a cyclical stock will do. Cyclical industries make or sell products that we can live without or delay buying when times are tough. Examples include luxury goods, non-business travel, and new construction. Non-Cyclical Stocks  Non-cyclical stocks repeatedly outperform the market when economic growth slows. They may also be  known as consumer staples since they are always in demand as basic needs. Non-cyclical securities are generally profitable regardless of economic trends because they produce  or distribute goods and services we always need, including things like food, power, water, and gas.",1099,183,274.75
224,"The stocks of companies that produce these goods and services are also called defensive stocks  because they can defend investors against the effects of an economic downturn. They are great  places in which to invest when the economic outlook is sour. For example, non-durable household goods like toothpaste, soap, shampoo, and dish detergent may not  seem like essentials, but they really can't be sacrificed. Most people don't feel they can wait  until next year to lather up with soap in the shower. A utility company is another example of a non-cyclical. People need power and heat for themselves  and their families. By providing a service that is consistently used, utility companies grow  conservatively and do not fluctuate dramatically. This is a key fact about non-cyclical stocks. They provide safety, but they are not going to  skyrocket in price when the economy grows. Investing in non-cyclical stocks is a good way to avoid losses when highly-cyclical companies are suffering.",992,165,248.0
224,"Example  Below is a historical example that uses a chart showing the performance of a highly-cyclical  company, the Ford Motor Co. (blue line), and a classic non-cyclical company, Florida Public  Utilities Co. (yellow line). This chart clearly demonstrates how each company's share price reacts  to downturns in the economy. Notice that the downturn in the economy from 2000 to 2002 drastically reduced Ford's share price,  whereas the growth of Florida Public Utilities' share price barely blinked at the slowdown. This is  because cars are considered discretionary goods that are cyclical to the economy. When there is a  recession, people choose not to spend on a new car in order to save money for basic needs. Moreover, more people may be unemployed at the time. If a car is needed, perhaps those people will  search for a used car instead.",845,147,211.25
225,"On the other hand, regardless of one's employment or the state of the economy.people still need to  have water and electricity on in their homes. That means people will still pay their utility bills  (for the most part), even when they begin to struggle financially, making it non-cyclical. What Are Some Examples of Cyclical Stocks?Cyclical stocks tend to be for expensive durable goods, luxury, or leisure. Therefore, stocks in the automotive industry, consumer durables, airlines, luxury goods makers, and hospitality stocks would be prime examples. What Are Consumer Cyclical Stocks?Sometimes analysts break down cyclical stocks into consumer and non-consumer. A non-consumer cyclical would be a company that sells to businesses, governments, or large organizations and which is also sensitive to the state of the economy. A consumer cyclical would be a cyclical stock that markets to individuals or households.",915,141,228.75
225,"What Types of Stocks Are Non-Cyclicals?Non-cyclical stocks are companies from which people will continue to consume their products even during an economic downturn. These often include consumer staple goods, food, gasoline, utilities, and pharmaceuticals/healthcare. The Bottom Line  Cyclical companies follow the trends in the overall economy, and therefore their stock prices are volatile. Non-cyclic d regardless of the state of the economy. Therefore, non-cyclical stocks can be profitable regardless of economic tre ws. Investing in non-cyclical stocks is considered to be safer than investing in cyclical stocks. During economic turndowns, non-cyclical companies won't produce the losses that highly-cyclical  companies do. But for the same reason, when the economy grows, non-cyclical stocks won't surge in  price either. What Is a Back Stop?",849,124,212.25
225,"In corporate finance and investment banking, a back stop (or backstop) is to provide last-resort  support or to make a bid in a securities offering for the unsubscribed portion of shares. When a company is trying to raise capital through an issuance—and wants to guarantee the amount  received through the issue—it may get a back stop from an underwriter or a major shareholder, such  as an investment bank, to buy any of its unsubscribed shares. Key Takeaways A back stop is the act of providing last-resort support or security in a securities offering for the unsubscribed portion of shares. When a company is trying to raise capital through an issuance, it may get a back stop from an underwriter or a major shareholder, such as an investment bank, to buy any of its unsubscribed shares. Back stops function as a type of ""insurance"" and support for the overall offering, ensuring that the offering does not fail if all shares are not subscribed. How a Back Stop Works  A back stop functions as a form of insurance. While not an actual insurance plan, a company can  guarantee that a certain amount of its offering will be purchased by particular organizations,  usually investment banking firms, if the open market does not produce enough investors and a  portion of the offering goes unsold.",1295,227,323.75
226,"If the organization providing the back stop is an investment banking firm, sub-underwriters  representing the investment firm will enter into an agreement with the company. This agreement is  referred to as a firm-commitment underwriting deal or contract, and it provides overall support for  the offering by committing to purchase a specific number of unsold shares. By entering into a firm-commitment underwriting agreement, the associated organization has claimed  full responsibility for the quantity of shares specified if they initially go unsold, and promises  to provide the associated capital in exchange for the available shares. Take the Next Step to Invest Advertiser Disclosure The offers that appear in this table are from partnerships from which Investopedia receives compensation. This compensation may impact how and where listings appear. Investopedia does not include all offers available in the marketplace. This gives assurance to the issuer that the minimum capital can be raised regardless of the open  market activity. Additionally, all risk associated with the specified shares is effectively  transferred to the underwritten organization. If all of the offering is purchased through regular investment vehicles, the contract obligating  the organization to purchase any unsold shares is rendered void, as the conditions surrounding the  promise to purchase no longer exist. The contracts between an issuer and the underwriting organization can take various forms.",1489,226,372.25
226,"For example, the underwriting organization can provide the issuer with a revolving credit loan to boost credit ratings for the issuer. They may also issue letters of credit as guarantees to the entity raising capital through offerings. Special Considerations  If the underwriting organization takes possession of any shares, as specified in the agreement, the  shares belong to the organization to manage as it sees fit. The shares are treated the same way as  any other investment purchased through normal market activity. The issuing company can impose no  restrictions on how the shares are traded. The underwriting organization may subsequently hold or sell the associated securities per the  regulations that govern the activity overall. Example of a Back Stop  In a rights offering, you may see a statement to this effect: ""ABC Company will provide a 100  percent back stop of up to $100 million for any unsubscribed portion of the XYZ Company rights  offering.""If XYZ is trying to raise $200 million, but only raises $100 million through investors,  then ABC Company purchases the remainder. What Is a Back Stop in a Bond Issue?Similar to the back stop in an equity placement, a back stop for a bond issue is a type of guarantee whereby the underwriting bank or syndicate will fix a price at which to purchase any unsold or unsubscribed bonds.",1350,231,337.5
227,"Who Are Backstop Purchasers?If the underwriting bank or investment banking syndicate cannot or do not want to back stop a new issue, third-party backstop purchasers may be called upon to step in and buy any unsubscribed portion of a securities issue. These purchasers may provide a bid substantially below the issue price and/or may demand fees as compensation. They would then often try to sell off the holdings over time at a profit. What Are Volcker Rule Backstop Provisions?The Volcker Rule is a set of financial regulations that separates the commercial and investment banking activities of a firm. Its purpose is to prevent conflicts of interest and unfair practices to the detriment of a bank's customers. One provision of the Rule is to prevent the backstopping of a securities issue by an underwriting bank if it will create a conflict of interest. Moreover, a back stop would be prohibited if it would ""result, directly or indirectly, in a material exposure by the banking entity to a high-risk asset or a high-risk trading strategy; or pose a threat to the safety and soundness of the banking entity or to the financial stability of the United States.""1 IPO, OFS, and FPO – How are they different?",1208,204,302.0
227,"IPO Initial Public Offering is when a company is introduced into the publicly traded stock markets for the first time. In the IPO, the company’s promoters choose to offer a certain percentage of shares to the public. The reason for going public and the process of an IPO is explained in detail in Chapters 4 and 5. The primary reason for going public is to raise capital to fund expansion projects or cash out early investors. After the IPO is listed on the exchange and is traded in the secondary market, promoters of the company might still want additional capital. There are three options available: Rights Issue, Offer for Sale and Follow-on Public Offer. Rights Issue The promoters can choose to raise additional capital from its existing shareholders by offering them new shares at a discounted price (generally lower than Market Price). The company offers new shares in the proportion of shares already held by the shareholders. For example, a 1:4 Rights Issue would mean that every 4 shares held 1 additional share is offered. Although this option looks good, it limits the company to raise the capital from a small number of investors who are already holding shares of the company and might not want to invest more.",1224,209,306.0
227,"A rights issue leads to the creation of new shares that are offered to the shareholders, which dilutes the value of the previously held shares. An example of a Rights issue is South Indian Bank which announced a 1:3(One share for every 3 held) issue for Rs 14 which is 30% lower than the Market Price the stock was trading (Rs 20 as on Record date 17 Feb 2017). The bank offered 45.07 lakh shares to the existing shareholders. The rights issue is covered in detail in Chapter 11, covering key Corporate Actions. OFS The promoters can choose to offer the secondary issue of shares to the whole market, unlike a rights issue restricted to existing shareholders. The Exchange provides a separate window through the stockbrokers for the Offer for Sale. The exchange allows a company to route funds through OFS only if the Promoters want to sell out their holdings and/or maintain minimum public shareholding requirements (Govt. PSU have a public shareholding requirement of 25%). There is a floor price set by the company, at or above which both Retail and Non-Retail investors can make bids. The shares are allotted, if bids are at a cut-off price or above will be settled by the exchange into the investor Demat account in T+1 days.",1230,214,307.5

The OFS was held on 29th August 2017 for Non-Retail Investors and 30th August 2017. FPO An FPO also has the same intent of raising additional capital after it has been listed but follows a different mechanism for applying and allotting shares. Shares can be diluted, and fresh shares can be created and offered in an FPO. Just like an IPO, an FPO requires that Merchant Bankers be",550,102,137.5

Investors can place their bids through ASBA and shares are allotted based on the Cut-off Price decided after the book-building process. Since the introduction of OFS in 2012, FPOs are seldom used due to the lengthy approval process. The company decides on a Price Band, and the FPO is publicly advertised. Prospective investors can bid for the issue using the ASBA portal through Internet Banking or apply offline through a Bank Branch. After the bidding process is complete, the cut-off price is declared based on the demand and the additional shares allotted are listed on the exchange for trading in the secondary markets. An example of an FPO is of Engineers India Ltd which underwent an issue in February 2014 with Rs 145-Rs 150. The issue was oversubscribed by 3 times. The shares on the day of the starting date of the issue were trading at Rs 151.1. The lower price band was at a 4.2% discount from the market price.",1060,186,265.0

Dilution of shares is allowed in an FPO leading to change in Shareholding structure while OFS does not affect the number of authorized shares. Only the companies with a Market Capitalisation of Rs 1000 crores and above can use the OFS route to raise funds while all the listed companies can use the FPO option.

Each time I changed my car, the engine remained more or less the same, but the features within the vehicle and its aesthetics continuously changed. Air conditioner, power steering, and power windows were all luxury features in the car at one point, but today, I guess no one buys a car without these essential features. The game-changer for me though was parking assist. The little camera at the back of the car gave me complete visibility of the parking space available.

Order placement You can extend the position sizing concept and use the 20 depth market watch to place a stop loss or a limit order. Assume you have an intraday buy position in VST Tillers at 1313.8. The question is, where you would place the stop loss for this trade?Can the 20 market depth help us with this?Of course. Have a look at the 20 depth window for VST Tillers. As you can see, there is a concentration of bids in 1290. The good part is that the number of order count is also the highest (35) in 1290.",779,148,194.75
229,"This implies that several traders have placed an order at 1290, indicating some sort of price action at that level. This perhaps builds a case for placing the stop-loss. A prudent trader would probably place a stoploss not at 1290, but maybe at a price just below it. So I was a buyer in this stock, then purely based on 20 depth I’d probably place my SL at 1290 or below, maybe at 1287 and by the same logic, set my target at 1340 or at 1338.8. Validate the support and resistance level",487,93,121.75
230,"I find this extremely interesting. In the example above, we identified 1290 as the stoploss price, simply because there was a concentration of bids. In other words, we expect 1290 as a support price. If this is indeed true, then it should show up on the charts as well, right?Have a look at the chart below – Clearly, there is some price action around 1296. Remember, support and resistance is not one price point, but rather a range. Therefore 1290 – 1300 marks as an intraday support for this stock. This is a perfect example of seeing the price action concept play out in the market. Another way to look at this is first to identify the S&R level and then check the 20 depth to figure if there is a concentration of bids/offers in that zone. Hopefully, by now you’ve started to appreciate the immeasurable value 20 depth order book brings to you while trading.",863,156,215.75
230,"Remember, irrespective of which technique you use to develop a point of view (technical or quantitative analysis), things boil down to price, and the action trades take at that price.

If you’ve ever wanted to invest in a particular company’s stock, but didn’t have enough money to  buy even one share, or you want to effectively diversify your funds, investing in fractional shares  might be an affordable way to get started. Fractional shares allow investors to buy a portion, or  fraction, of a stock based on a dollar amount that the investor can afford–not based on a  particular number of shares. Implementing this type of strategy is propitious for investors who may  be starting out with a limited amount of money, but still want to build a diversified portfolio. We’ll take an in-depth look at how investing in fractional shares works and answer the basic  questions that investors need to know to get started.

It is also important to remember that every brokerage has slightly different nuances to the way Which stocks can be bought in fractional sharesHow trades are executed and settledFees Step 3: Fund the account. You will need to fund the account once you open it. Many online brokers can be funded vi the funds to settle, so you may not be able to invest right away. Step 4: Complete and monitor your investment. Most online accounts make it very easy to monitor  your portfolio using the main dashboard. Typically, you are able to see all of your account  holdings at a glance, but you may also be able to utilize more advanced options, such as setting up  stock alerts or automatic rebalancing, depending on what is offered by your particular online  brokerage.",1094,190,273.5

While there are several benefits to investing in fractional shares, the following drawbacks are  also worth considering:  Limited stock selection: Just because a stock is publicly traded does not mean that you will be  able to buy fractional shares of it. Each brokerage has their own curated list of stocks that  investors can buy fractional shares of. Potential problems transferring fractional shares to a different broker: If you want to transfer  your account to another brokerage, you may not be able to transfer the fractional shares. You may  need to liquidate any fractional shares in order to transfer. Proxy voting may not be an option: Again, each firm also handles proxy voting differently regarding  fractional shares. Make sure you know your company’s policy on this ahead of time.",1173,197,293.25
232,"Additional fees: Some brokerages charge additional fees for fractional share investing. This can  potentially decrease profits, especially for low-dollar investment amounts. Find out if there are  fees associated with fractional shares and if they are flat fees or a percentage. Trade execution may not take place in real time: If the brokerage that you are investing with does  not settle your trade in real time, that could affect your cost basis. Some firms will settle all  the fractional shares in one or more bulk orders rather than settling each order individually. Obviously, prices can fluctuate throughout a trading day, so understanding how this will be settled  is important. Can complicate tax returns: Because you are buying fractional shares, and may buy several  fractional shares throughout the year, depending on your investment strategy, you may end up  holding several different tax lots that may be difficult to match up at tax time. If a stock you  own has a dividend that you automatically reinvest, you will have additional tax lots to deal with.  Factors to Consider When Investing in Fractional Shares  Selection of stocks and ETFs available for fractional share investing: Because each online  brokerage has its own select list of stocks or ETFs that they offer for fractional share investing,  it is important to know this ahead of time.

Often,  investors can buy fractional shares for as low as $1. Balance and investment minimums will differ  from broker to broker. Research amenities: Once you open an account with an online broker or robo-advisor, you will have  access to research amenities.

FAQs  What Are Fractional Shares?Fractional shares are very simply a portion, or fraction, of a whole share. When investing in fractional shares, you will buy a portion of a stock share. With this strategy, you are investing based on a dollar amount, not an individual stock’s price or certain number of shares. Buying fractional shares provides investors with a lower entry point of accessibility, thereby allowing investors to gain market entry sooner. While the concept of trading in fractional shares has been around since 1999, the strategy really wasn’t widely available—or financially feasible—until 2019. A few low-fee companies offered fractional shares at that time, but this didn’t last very long.1 Around 2019, online brokers cut fees drastically to offer low fees or no monthly fees, thus creating",1035,165,258.75
233,"a path for investing in fractional shares to become advantageous. Prior to 2019 your portfolio may have had fractional shares, but it was most likely due to a few, limited circumstances: owning mutual funds, stock splits, dividend reinvestment programs, or company mergers or acquisitions. How Does Fractional Share Investing Work?Your experience with investing in fractional shares will differ depending on which brokerage you decide to invest through. Each brokerage has its own guidelines, so finding out exactly what is offered will be important before deciding to invest. For example:The list of stocks will differ from broker to broker, as well as whether it offers EFTs for fractional share investing. Some brokers charge additional fees for fractional shares. Some brokers may offer fractional share trading in real time, others may settle all fractional share trades in one or more large orders–which could affect share price, depending on how much the stock price fluctuated throughout the day between order time and trade execution time. If you are only buying a fraction of a share, you will also only get a fraction of the dividend, if the stock receives one. For example, if you want to invest in a stock that is trading at $100 per share, you don’t need to have $100 to buy a full share, you can instead invest $25 and own one-fourth of a share.",1360,226,340.0
233,"If this same stock happens to get a dividend that is $0.40 per share, you would likewise get one-fourth of the dividend, or $0.10. One online brokerage to offer fractional shares is Charles Schwab. Schwab refers to a fractional share as a “slice.”When buying a Schwab stock slice, investors have the choice to buy slices of 30 stocks in companies on the S&P 500 in one transaction.2 These shares can then be held and sold independently. One way to think of it is like investing in a mutual fund, but you have the flexibility to trade the individual stocks, or stock fractions. Are Fractional Shares a Good Idea?Buying fractional shares can be beneficial in several ways: affordability, diversification, and dollar cost averaging. Affordability: You don’t have to wait until you have hundreds or thousands of dollars in order to buy enough shares of a stock. You can start investing with many online brokerages in fractional shares with only $1. Diversification: Investing lower dollar amounts and being able to diversify used to only be available in mutual funds.",1063,177,265.75
233,"However, now that many brokerages offer fractional shares, investors can choose which companies they want to invest in, and can trade the fractional shares at any time—unlike a mutual fund, which is bought and sold as a “basket” of stocks. Having the option to only invest in a fractional share allows investors to choose several stocks rather than putting all of their money into just one company in order to purchase a certain amount of whole shares. Dollar cost averaging: Because investing in fractional shares is an option, investors can choose to pick a specific dollar amount to invest each month, for instance. By investing on a regular basis, investors can take advantage of price fluctuations in the market while also hedging against risk.  Can You Buy Fractional Shares Through Fidelity?Yes, you can buy fractional shares through Fidelity. With a minimum account balance of $0, and fractional share investing starting at only $1, Fidelity makes it easy to open an account and start investing in fractional shares. In fact, Investopedia ranks Fidelity as the Best Online Broker for ETFs, so if investing in fractional shares of ETFs is important to you, this company may be a great option. In all, Fidelity offers over 7,000 US stocks and ETFs in which investors can buy fractional shares.3 Do Fractional Shares Make You Money?Investing in such small dollar amounts may not seem like a way to make money.",1414,236,353.5
233,"If you treat this like contributing to an IRA or 401k on a monthly basis, though, your multiple, small investments will add up over time and create a very nice savings account. While one individual purchase is only buying a portion of a stock, or portions of several stocks, investing over months or years will allow those fractional shares to keep building, potentially into several full shares of several stocks. Can You Buy Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) as Fractional Shares?",477,79,119.25
234,"Yes, some companies will offer ETFs as fractional shares. Because each brokerage has different fractional share offerings, it is important to find out if the firm you want to invest with offers ETFs as fractional shares and what other stocks are on its fractional share list. Are Fractional Shares Harder to Sell?The answer to this will depend upon how your brokerage handles the selling of fractional shares. Some brokerage firms do not guarantee liquidity of fractional shares. This will differ from broker to broker, so it is something to consider when choosing which firm you want to invest with. Liquidity refers to the ability to easily sell a stock or security and convert to cash. Even though you can buy fractional shares, you may not be able to sell fractional portions as easily as whole shares.4  Issued Share Capital vs. Subscribed Share Capital: An Overview  Share capital refers to the amount of funding a company raises through the sale of stock to public  investors. This means the company grants shareholders a small ownership stake in the company in  exchange for monetary investment. Share capital constitutes the main source of equity financing and  can be generated through the sale of common or preferred shares.",1235,208,308.75
234,"Common stock is what most people think of when they talk about the stock market. Common, or  ordinary, shareholders have voting rights and participate in major company decisions.1 Although  companies at times pay dividends on common shares, they are not required to pay them. Key Takeaways Share capital is the total of all funds raised by a company through the sale of equity to investors. Issued share capital is the value of shares actually held by investors. Subscribed share capital is the value of shares investors have promised to buy when they are released. Subscribed shared capital is usually part of an IPO. Preferred shares, also called preference shares, do not entail the same kinds of ownership rights as common shares. However, they generally include a guaranteed dividend each year that must be paid  before any dividends can be distributed to common shareholders. In short, though preferred  shareholders have fewer rights, they do have a higher claim on company assets.2 Although share capital refers to a dollar amount, it is dictated by the number and selling price of  a company's shares. For example, if a company issues 1,000 shares for $25 per share, it generates  $25,000 in share capital.",1215,205,303.75
234,"Share capital is only generated by the initial sale of shares by the company to investors. If the  investor goes on to trade those shares to a third party, any profit made on the sale does not  contribute to the issuing company's share capital.  Issued Share Capital  Issued shares are the shares sold to and held by company investors. These investors can include  large institutions or individual retail investors. Sometimes, large institutional purchases of  shares may only be partially paid for and will be accounted as called-up share capital. The amount  already received in payment is the paid-up share capital. When fully paid, the amount is recorded  as paid-in share capital.",685,119,171.25
235,"Issued share capital is simply the monetary value of the shares of stock a company actually offers  for sale to investors. The number of issued shares generally corresponds to the amount of  subscribed share capital, though neither amount can exceed the authorized amount. When a company prepares to ""go public"" by issuing stock for the first time, investors can submit an application expressing their desire to participate.3  Subscribed Share Capital  Subscribed shares are shares that investors have promised to buy. These shares are usually  subscribed as part of an initial public offering (IPO). Underwriters often promise to deliver a certain number of subscribed shares prior to the IPO. The  subscribers are usually large institutional investors and banks. Subscribed share capital refers to  the monetary value of all the shares for which investors have expressed an interest. Special Considerations  Share capital can fall into one of several other categories, depending on where the company is in  the equity-raising process. They include the following:  Authorized Share Capital  The maximum amount of share capital a company is allowed to raise is called its authorized capital. Though this does not limit the number of shares a company may issue, it does put a ceiling on the  total amount of money that can be raised by the sale of those shares.",1360,228,340.0
235,"Called-Up vs. Paid-Up Share Capital  Depending on the business and applicable regulations, companies may issue stock to investors with  the understanding the investors will pay at a later date. Any funds due for shares issued but not  fully paid for are called-up share capital. Any funds remitted for shares are considered as paid-up  capital. Other types of capital, such as debt financing or mezzanine financing, are not considered share  capital. Debt capital includes financing sources such as lines of credit, business loans, and  credit card balances. While mezzanine financing, like share capital, is included under the equity  section of the balance sheet, it is not considered share capital. What Is CANSLIM?

Again, annual EPS growth should ideally be in excess of 20% over the last three to five years. N: New products, management, or positive new events that push the company's stock to new highs. This type of headline news can cause short-term excitement, propelling a surge of optimism within the market and subsequent price appreciation. S: Scarce supply coupled with a strong appetite for a stock creates excess demand and an environment in which share prices can soar.

An RSI reading of above 70 signifies that a stock could be overbought or overvalued and could be a chance to sell (bearish). I: Pick stocks that have institutional sponsorship by a few institutions with recent above-average performance.

A theoretical ex-rights price (TERP) is the market price that a stock will theoretically have  following a new rights issue. Companies may use a new rights issuance to offer more shares to  shareholders, usually at a discounted price. Stock prices are affected by new rights issuance  because it increases the number of shares outstanding. Key Takeaways TERP is the theoretical market price of a stock after the completion of a rights offering. New rights issues result in an increase in the number of shares available and therefore have an impact on the price of the underlying stock. Typically, rights offerings give shareholders the chance to buy more shares at a discounted price, causing a dilution effect. Generally, the TERP will be lower than the pre-offering market price immediately following the rights issuing period. Theoretical Ex-Rights Price Explained  A theoretical ex-rights price is a consideration for stock issued through a rights offering.",1227,202,306.75
237,"Typically, rights offerings are only available for current shareholders and only offered for  a short time (approximately 30 days). Rights offerings usually give shareholders the option to buy  a proportioned number of shares at a discounted, pre-specified price. The portion each shareholder  is allowed to purchase is based on the shareholder's current stake in the organization. The goal is  to raise additional capital with preference given to current shareholders. Stock rights offerings can be a popular event for investors and traders as they may create  potential arbitrage opportunities through the rights offering period. Overall the rights offering  period can somewhat mitigate efficient market trading as it creates uncertainty over the stock’s  price. Generally, stock rights offerings are tools managers can use in raising capital through the stock. Management may choose to use stock rights offerings to generate additional interest in a company’s  stock. Since rights offerings are commonly offered at a discounted price, stock rights usually have  a diluting effect on a stock’s price. As such, the TERP is usually lower than the pre-offering  market price.",1175,186,293.75
237,"Calculation of a Theoretical Ex-Rights Price  The theoretical ex-rights price is usually calculated immediately following the last day of a  stock’s rights offering. This calculation makes the stock’s price somewhat arbitrary and  potentially more enticing for arbitrage trades throughout the rights offering period. The simplest way to create a TERP estimate is to add the current market value of all shares  existing before the rights issue to the total funds raised from the rights issue sales. This number  is then divided by the total number of shares in existence after the rights issue is complete. This  calculation results in the value of an individual share after the offering.  Throughout the offering period, all types of investors can speculate on the number of shares",781,130,195.25
238,"expected to be taken by shareholders, but usually, only current shareholders can participate. The  basis for speculation in this scenario involves the number of share rights available, the expected  demand, and the rights offering price. Companies may have various types of disclosure for this  information which can make the estimate even more difficult. The theoretical ex-rights price (TERP) is often lower than the stock's price before the offering because rights offerings are usually discounted, diluting the stock price. Investor Analysis  Investors can compare the TERP to the current value of a share and their expectations for future  market appreciation. Since rights are offered at a discounted price, the more rights exercised, the  more the stock’s price becomes diluted. However, throughout the rights offering period, supply and  demand still affect the market price so while dilution is occurring, investor demand can still  increase the prevailing market price. Investors who are bullish on the stock long term may be more  motivated by the offering while bearish or short-term investors may not see as much upside. Real-World Example  Management of ABC Company has chosen to issue a rights offering. The provisions of the offering  allow each shareholder to buy shares in the offering based on the percentage of their outstanding  shares.",1357,220,339.25
238,"The new shares are offered to investors at a discounted price to the market price. Shareholders can use the TERP to determine the estimated value of the shares after the rights  issue. This amount will differ from the current market price. It is possible for multiple theoretical estimated values to be calculated for the stock before the end of the offering pe ook at the TERP  value if 25% of the shares are purchased in the rights offering versus 50%, 75%, or 100%. Overall  the more shares bought, the greater the potential for dilution when the shares are sold at a  discounted offering price. What Is a Shareholder Register?  A shareholder register is a list of active owners of a company's shares, updated on an ongoing  basis. The shareholder register requires that every current shareholder is recorded. The register  includes each person's name, address, and the number of shares owned. In addition, the register can  detail the holder's occupation and the price they paid for the shares.",998,175,249.5

Key Takeaways A shareholder register is a list of active owners of a company's shares, updated on an ongoing basis. Included in the register are the shareholder’s name and physical address, while some registers detail the last decade of shareholder transactions. The shareholder list is used for several purposes, including taxation, mailing proxy materials, and dividend payments. How a Shareholder Register Works  A shareholder register must note all shares issued by a company. In addition, it should detail any  possible restrictions on transferring shares, along with relevant citations, if available. For each  share class, the register must also list shareholders by name, in alphabetical order, and each  party’s last known physical address. Some shareholder registers go as far as to detail all issues of shares to each individual",1060,172,265.0
239,"shareholder in the last 10 years, along with the date of any and all transfers of shares. This can  also include the name of the party to whom shares have been transferred. The shareholder register should include the purchase prices of these shares, too. If shares are not  fully paid for, the register must note the unpaid amount. Special Considerations  Additional critical components of company record keeping include a current and projected capital  structure. This document, often in an Excel file, details the financing of a company’s present  operations and future goals for growth. Sources of funds can come from issuing equity (new shares of which would be noted in real-time in  the shareholder register), and debt. Equity can be in the form of common or preferred stock, while  debt can be short-term or long-term in nature. Requirements for a Shareholder Register  A shareholder register is a clear record of beneficial owners of shares—shareholders who are  entitled to and may exercise voting rights attached to the shares, along with other particular  rights and powers, and receive dividends. Access is free for current shareholders and may require a small fee for non-shareholders.",1198,201,299.5

Per the rules outlined by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), a company must provide  shareholders with the contact info of other shareholders in two instances. The first is proxy  solicitations and the second is in a tender offer. A proxy solicitation contains information to be  sent to voting shareholders prior to a shareholder meeting. The solicitation might include  information about the company and the items on the agenda that need a shareholder vote. A tender  offer is a public offer or bid to purchase some or all of the shares in a corporation. The company can either mail the list to the requesting party or send the materials directly to  shareholders. Meanwhile, companies may provide access to the shareholder register per state laws or  a company’s by-laws and charter. What Is a Bearer Share?

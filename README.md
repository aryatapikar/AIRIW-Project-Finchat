Abstract

FinChat is an innovative chatbot engineered to deliver user-friendly and reliable answers to finance-related queries. By harnessing advanced language models and cutting-edge technology, FinChat facilitates natural and insightful conversations, effectively demystifying complex financial concepts for users. Utilizing authoritative sources such as Zerodha Varsity, FinChat ensures that its responses are both accurate and trustworthy. The project's primary objective is to empower users to make well-informed financial decisions through clear and concise guidance. A key feature of FinChat is its use of web scraping techniques to retrieve real-time financial information, which is then utilized in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to optimize response accuracy and relevance. Additionally, FinChat incorporates continuous improvements and user feedback to enhance its functionality, ensuring it remains a valuable and up-to-date resource in the rapidly evolving financial landscape.
